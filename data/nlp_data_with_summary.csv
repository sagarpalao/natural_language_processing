Earlier this month, U.S. officials placed the company on a trade blacklist. NSO has also faced either legal action or criticism from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O).NSO is allegedly involved in circumventing security for products made by these companies and selling that circumvention in the form of hacking tools to foreign governments.In a statement, NSO, which says it sells its tools only to governments and law enforcement agencies and has safeguards in place to prevent misuse, said that ""thousands of lives"" have been saved through the use of its tools.“Pedophiles and terrorists can freely operate in technological safe-havens, and we provide governments the lawful tools to fight it.

Apple said that its servers were not hacked, but that NSO misused and manipulated the servers to deliver the attacks on Apple users.Apple also alleged that NSO Group was directly involved in providing consulting services for the attacks, which is noteworthy because NSO has maintained that it sells its tools to clients.""Defendants force Apple to engage in a continual arms race: Even as Apple develops solutions and enhances the security of its devices, Defendants are constantly updating their malware and exploits to overcome Apple’s own security upgrades,"" Apple said.Apple said it has so far seen no evidence of NSO's tools being used against Apple devices using iOS 15, the latest version of its mobile operating system.The iPhone maker said that it will donate $10 million, as well as any damages recovered in the lawsuit, to cybersurveillance research groups including Citizen Lab, the University of Toronto group that first discovered NSO's attacks.","NSO is also seeking to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services.

CNN,apple,2,Apple is asking a court to put on hold its injunction that would allow iPhone developers to direct users away from the company's App Store for online payments.,https://t.co/51JaecmVNm?amp=1,"Apple is asking a court to put on hold its injunction that would allow iPhone developers to direct users away from the company's App Store for online payments. The company on Friday filed a motion with the US District Court for the Northern District of California asking it to stay a September 10 injuction under a lawsuit against Apple by video game company Epic Games. The injunction, currently scheduled to take effect December 9, states that Apple (AAPL) can no longer prohibit developers from adding links within their apps to outside payment options; for example, alerting users to the option to pay for a subscription on a web browser, rather than through the app.Apple is asking the court to suspend that requirement by November, weeks before the deadline when it will be required to make the changes to the App Store requirements. The request accompanied Apple's formal appeal of the September decision. It's the latest step in a long-running legal battle between Apple and Epic Games, the maker of hugely popular video game Fortnite. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in September sided with Apple on most of the lawsuit's claims, saying she could not conclude that the iPhone maker is a monopoly. But she sided with Epic on one count — Apple cannot prohibit app makers from telling their users there are ways to pay outside the App Store. Apple takes a cut of up to 30% of most in-app transactions on its devices.Epic appealed the decision days after it was announced, and the companies' disagreements have only gotten more contentious since then.Apple announced shortly after the decision that it would not allow Fortnite back on its devices until the appeals process has concluded, which means the game could be barred from iPhones for several years. If Gonzalez Rogers grants Apple's latest request, it could buy the company a similar amount of time to avoid being forced to make changes to the App Store.",Apple filed a motion with the US District Court for a court to stay a September 10 injunction.

Parrish said Apple told her she was fired for deleting files from her work devices before turning them over to the company as part of an internal investigation into leaks to the press.The move marks the latest escalation of a growing rift between Apple and its employees, who in recent months have broken with the company's historic culture of secrecy to speak out on controversial hiring decisions, alleged pay disparities and remote work policies. Parrish and a colleague, Cher Scarlett, create #AppleToo in August to help Apple employees ""organize and protect ourselves,"" according to the movement's website. They called on coworkers to share stories of issues they faced including racism, sexism and discrimination in order to outline ""changes we expect to see Apple make."" Parrish told CNN Business Friday they received hundreds of reports in the weeks since then, about incidents that ""range the gamut from sexism and ageism to disclosures of rape and suicide.""Apple did not comment specifically on Parrish's firing. Scarlett, who remains at the company, declined to comment. ""We are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace,"" Apple spokesperson Josh Rosenstock said in a statement to CNN. ""We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and, out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters.""According to Parrish, the company began investigating her on September 30, days after CEO Tim Cook sent a memo to employees warning that ""people who leak confidential information do not belong here."" The memo, and the leaks from a prior town hall meeting that prompted it, were first reported by The Verge. Parrish, who said she was not behind the leaks but had spoken publicly to the press about problems at Apple, was asked to hand in her work-issued devices to the company but she deleted some personal information beforehand.""Apple encourages us to merge our private and work devices fairly thoroughly for testing purposes,"" she said. ""I had some private conversations, private information such as Robinhood investments, things that frankly aren't Apple's business to know."" She said those deletions were what Apple cited as the reason for firing her. Parrish directed questions on whether she plans further action against Apple to her lawyer, Chris Albanese, who told CNN Business that he is ""exploring all different avenues on behalf of our client."" The goal behind starting #AppleToo, Parrish said, was calling attention to ""systemic issues"" within Apple's culture that have been ""systematically swept under the rug"" by the company.""One thing about Apple's culture is that it is a deeply secretive company,"" she said, adding that employees in the office often don't know what the person next to them is working on.

Apple's move comes as electronics manufacturers — as well as the makers of everything from tractors to hospital equipment — face increasing pressure to ease restrictions on independent device repair shops or DIY repairs, a push known as the ""right to repair"" movement. Companies have been criticized for using tactics that make it harder for independent repair businesses to access devices, such as using non-removable memory or batteries, or sealing devices with special glue. Critics argue these tactics can lead to more costs for consumers, hurt independent repair shops and be bad for the environment. President Joe Biden passed an executive order in July that directed the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules requiring companies to allow DIY repairs. Days later, the FTC unanimously voted to condemn existing repair restrictions by manufacturers, with the agency's chair, Lina Khan, vowing to ""root out"" illegal repair restrictions that may flout US antitrust and consumer protection laws.Regulators in the United Kingdom and Europe have also either already passed or are considering legislation to force device manufacturers to provide their customers with spare parts.It's not just regulators. One of the noteworthy advocates for the ""right to repair"" movement has been Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who said earlier this year that he was ""totally supportive"" of the cause. ""We wouldn't have had an Apple had I not grown up in a very open technology world,"" he said in a video on the celebrity shout-out website Cameo.iFixit, a popular online repair website for consumer electronics that has criticized Apple and other companies for not allowing self repairs, welcomed Wednesday's announcement. ""We're thrilled to see Apple admit what we've always known: Everyone's enough of a Genius to fix an iPhone,"" iFixit said on Twitter.Companies like Apple have previously argued their repair policies were in place to ensure the products are properly repaired. ""We believe the safest and most reliable repair is one handled by a trained technician using genuine parts that have been properly engineered and rigorously tested,"" Apple COO Jeff Williams said in a 2019 release announcing Apple's independent repair shop partner program.On Wednesday, Williams touted Apple's announcement as giving ""customers even more choice if a repair is needed."" He also said the company ""has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and training, and now we're providing an option for those who wish to complete their own repairs.""Apple said there are more than 2,800 independent repair providers across 200 countries that have access to its parts and repair knowledge. For now, the Self Service Repair program will only be available in the United States at launch, but Apple said it plans to expand the program to other countries over the course of 2022.","Apple announces a new program to make spare parts available to purchase starting next year.

CNN,apple,9,"Apple affirms employees' right to speak about working conditions, in a win for #AppleToo movement",https://t.co/jFFw4Wq9um?amp=1,"Apple posted a statement to its employees Friday evening reminding them of their rights to speak up about their pay and working conditions. The move comes after months of employee organizing in a movement that's come to be known as #AppleToo.  ""Apple is deeply committed to providing employees with a workplace where they feel safe, respected, and inspired to do their best work,"" the company said in the statement posted to an internal employee portal, which was obtained by CNN Business. ""Our policies do not restrict employees from speaking freely about their wages, hours, or working conditions."" The statement added that employees are welcome to raise concerns ""in the way they feel most comfortable, internally or externally."" NBC first reported the memo Friday. In recent months, Apple (AAPL) employees have broken with the company's historic culture of secrecy to speak out on controversial hiring decisions, alleged pay disparities and remote work policies.  Apple did not respond to requests for comment for this article.  Two Apple employees, Janneke Parrish and Cher Scarlett, started #AppleToo in August to help the company's workers ""organize and protect ourselves,"" according to the movement's website. They called on coworkers to share stories of issues they may have faced, including incidents of racism, sexism and discrimination, in order to outline ""changes we expect to see Apple make."" Parrish told CNN Business last month that they received hundreds of reports from employees within weeks about alleged incidents that ""range the gamut from sexism and ageism to disclosures of rape and suicide,"" she said. Parrish filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board earlier this month alleging that she was fired from her job as an Apple program manager in October in retaliation for her organizing efforts. (At the time, Apple said it does not discuss specific employee matters but that ""we take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised."" For her part, Scarlett said on Twitter last week that Friday was her last day at Apple. Friday's statement by Apple is a win for the #AppleToo movement, Parrish told CNN Business.  ""It's something that we've wanted Apple to communicate for the entirety of #AppleToo,"" Parrish said. ""It's definitely not the end of the road but it's a really big first step and it shows what workers speaking in unison can achieve."" She added that one common theme in the stories that employees have submitted to #AppleToo is that workers don't know that they're allowed to speak up when issues arise.

The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in California, alleges that NSO's spyware, known as Pegasus, and other malware have caused Apple monetary and property damages, and violated the human rights of Apple users along the way. ""To prevent further abuse and harm to its users, Apple is also seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices,"" Apple said in a statement. In a statement Tuesday, NSO Group did not address the specifics of the lawsuit and instead said the firm's technology saves lives.NSO Group provides ""lawful tools"" to help governments fight pedophiles and terrorists, the firm said.While NSO Group has long maintained that it only sells its software to authorized users for law enforcement and counterterrorism purposes, researchers have for years uncovered evidence that Pegasus has been used to surveil dissidents and human rights activists. Researchers from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab in September said that an unidentified party was using Pegasus, and a vulnerability in Apple operating software, to spy on a Saudi activist. The lawsuit is the latest setback for NSO Group, which cybersecurity analysts and human rights activists have long accused of doing business with repressive governments. The firm's easy-to-use spyware is capable of eavesdropping on a phone's communications and accessing other sensitive data on the device, according to researchers. The US Commerce Department this month added NSO Group to its so-called ""entity list,"" effectively banning the company from buying software components from US vendors without a license. Commerce accused NSO Group, and another Israeli firm known as Candiru, of providing spyware to foreign governments that ""used these tools to maliciously target"" journalists, embassy workers and activists.In a statement at the time, NSO Group said it was ""dismayed by the decision given that our technologies support US national security interests and policies by preventing terrorism and crime, and thus we will advocate for this decision to be reversed.""""We look forward to presenting the full information regarding how we have the world's most rigorous compliance and human rights programs that are based [on] the American values we deeply share,"" according to the statement, ""which already resulted in multiple terminations of contacts [sic] with government agencies that misused our products.""Candiru could not be reached for comment at the time.Apple is at least the second major US tech firm to sue NSO Group. Facebook (now known as Meta) in 2019 sued NSO Group for allegedly facilitating the breach of 1,400 phones running the WhatsApp messaging application. NSO Group has denied the allegations made by Facebook, and tried to block the case from moving forward. But a US appeals court this month ruled that the lawsuit could proceed.Apple said it would contribute $10 million, plus any damages from the lawsuit, to ""organizations pursuing cybersurveillance research and advocacy.""The lawsuit seeks unspecified punitive damages from NSO Group, as well as ""compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.""NSO Group is just one of several firms that sell specialized hacking tools to break into different types of mobile phones.  In its lawsuit, Apple's lawyers reflected on what it called a ""continual arms race"" between Apple engineers and NSO Group's code-writers.""Even as Apple develops solutions and enhances the security of its devices, Defendants are constantly updating their malware and exploits to overcome Apple's own security upgrades,"" the complaint states.","Apple accuses NSO Group of violating a federal anti-hacking law.

CNN,apple,11,"Janneke Parrish, a leader of an activist group within Apple, said she was fired on Thursday. The company's employees have recently pushed back against a culture of secrecy, saying it discouraged speaking up about issues like harassment and wage disparities.",https://t.co/IKE2a0Z4ea?amp=1,"A leader of an activist movement within Apple said she was fired by the company on Thursday.Janneke Parrish, who was a program manager for Apple Maps based in Austin, Texas, and one of the two leaders of a group that called itself #AppleToo, had been on suspension for several days while Apple investigated her activities. On Thursday, she said, an Apple lawyer and a human resources worker told her on a phone call that she was being fired.The reason, Ms. Parrish said she was told, was that she had deleted files from her company computer and phone before handing them over to be examined. She said she had deleted files that contained personal and financial information.Ms. Parrish, 30, said she believed Apple was retaliating against her for helping to organize the activist group. In recent months, Apple employees have uncharacteristically spoken out and said the company’s culture of secrecy — meant to prevent product leaks — pervaded other aspects of the company and discouraged workers from coming forward about issues like sexual harassment and wage disparities.“I knew from the moment that I started speaking that this was a risk, and a significant one,” Ms. Parrish said. “If me getting fired helps bring justice to people who have been seeking it, then it’s a sacrifice I’m happy to make,” she added. Ms. Parrish’s firing was reported earlier by The Verge.Apple did not directly address Ms. Parrish’s status with the company. “We are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace,” said Josh Rosenstock, an Apple spokesman, in a statement. “We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and, out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters.”An accompanying email notifying her of her termination, viewed by The New York Times, said Apple had “determined that you engaged in conduct in violation of Apple policies including, but not limited to, interfering with an investigation by deleting files on your company provided equipment after being specifically instructed not to do so.”Ms. Parrish said she had deleted innocuous screenshots of things like programming bugs she was working to fix off her computer desktop before handing it over. She said she also deleted the Robinhood stock trading app because she did not want Apple to see “how much money I lost investing in GameStop” and the Pokemon Go gaming app because “I feel a little embarrassed I played Pokemon Go.”She said she was investigated because company officials thought she had leaked a recording of an Apple staff meeting to the media, which she said she did not do.Ms. Parrish had also been publishing a weekly digest of accounts of workplace problems shared anonymously with her by Apple employees. She said she had received hundreds of the stories over the last few months, though she could not confirm that everyone who submitted a story was an Apple worker.Being fired, Ms. Parrish said, would not make her end her activism. “I don’t intend to stop until there’s justice,” she said.Advertisement","Janneke Parrish, 30, was on suspension for several days while Apple investigated her activities.

CNN,apple,12,Apple has unveiled new MacBook computers — and AirPods with better audio quality and longer battery life. Here's what to know.,https://t.co/ppArjYHRG5?amp=1,"Apple on Monday unveiled in an hourlong virtual event new MacBook computers powered by Apple-made processors and an updated model of its popular AirPods.Last year, Apple introduced a new line of computers with processors made by Apple with the assistance of a manufacturing partner, breaking its reliance on the chip maker Intel. The company said at the time that the new chip, called the M1, would make Apple devices faster and more power efficient.The new processors, the M1 Pro and the M1 Max, power a new MacBook Pro that comes in a 14-inch and 16-inch model, starting at $2,000 and $2,500. The upgraded computers will have faster processing speeds, better graphics, improved audio quality and a better camera, the company said.Apple also rolled back some of the changes it has made to its laptops over the years, bowing to consumer demand by getting rid of the unpopular Touch Bar, a touch screen strip above the keyboard, and re-adding ports for an HDMI cable and an SD memory card.Apple also released a third generation of AirPods with better audio quality and longer battery life, for $179 — a $20 increase from the second iteration of the product — along with a new Apple Music subscription.Apple computers helped make the company a famous brand, but the Mac lineup — luxury devices that typically cost upward of $900 — has always been a small fry in the PC market. Last quarter, Apple computers accounted for 7.4 percent of the global PC market, far behind Lenovo, HP and Dell, which made up more than 60 percent of sales, according to the research firm IDC.Apple’s AirPods have been immensely popular since their debut in 2016. The wireless earbuds are top sellers among “hearables,” wireless earphones with sensors that talk to phones. This year, AirPods have accounted for 57 percent of the market for high-end hearables, far ahead of Samsung, which had 17 percent, according to a report by Counterpoint Research.Apple’s announcement on Monday came just over a month after the tech giant unveiled a new line of iPhones — the iPhone 13 series — an upgraded Apple Watch and a new iPad.Aside from the hardware announcements, the company has faced increasing turmoil in recent months, including more frequent calls for regulation. Apple recently appealed a court decision in its lawsuit against Epic Games, which accused it of engaging in monopolistic behavior, and last week fired a leader of the #AppleToo movement, a group of employee activists.Advertisement","Apple unveils new MacBook computers powered by Apple-made processors.

CNN,apple,13,Apple’s most back-ordered new product is a $19 cloth to wipe smudges and fingerprints off screens.,https://t.co/NSqvjIJUig?amp=1,"It’s a $19 cloth.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Daisuke WakabayashiOAKLAND, Calif — Apple this month unveiled an array of new gadgets: more powerful MacBook laptop computers, AirPod wireless headphones with longer battery life and HomePod Mini speakers in three more colors.But a different and unheralded Apple release is garnering so much interest that it has become the company’s most back-ordered new product: a $19, 6.3-by-6.3-inch cloth to wipe smudges and fingerprints off screens.The cloth, imprinted with the Apple logo in the corner, is made with “soft, nonabrasive material” to clean the screens of iPhones, iPads and MacBooks “safely and effectively,” according to the product page. The listing adds that the Polishing Cloth — capital P, capital C — is “compatible” with 88 different Apple products. For most U.S. shoppers, shipment is delayed until Jan. 11, at the earliest.Charging $19 for a piece of cloth about the size of two stacked dollar bills is bold even by Apple’s standards, a company whose legions of loyal customers are conditioned to stomach steep prices. An Apple-branded set of four wheels to “improve mobility” for the Mac Pro, the company’s most expensive desktop computer, is priced at $699, for instance. But the Polishing Cloth stands out because it is far more expensive than widely available alternatives. MagicFiber, a popular brand of microfiber cloth that uses ultrafine fibers to clean glass without scratching the surface, offers a pack of six for $9 on Amazon.“You have to give them credit for the chutzpah to charge $19,” Walter Gonzalez, president and founder of Goja, the parent company of MagicFiber, said of Apple.Even so, the price has not stopped Apple fans from rushing to be early adopters.Albert Lee, 47, a director at a consulting firm in New York, said he bought the cloth at an Apple Store on Tuesday. He was picking up a new MacBook Pro, a high-end laptop computer, when the Polishing Cloth caught his eye. He bought four and then posted a picture of his bounty on Twitter.“It’s just a point of sheer excess,” Mr. Lee acknowledged, calling the splurge an impulse buy of “the most elite cloth.” He added: “I just spent $4,000 on a laptop. What’s another $19?” On Twitter, the cloth has been fodder for jokes and even a parody account since Apple quietly put it on sale on Oct. 18. Later that week, when Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, posted a tweet promoting a new retail store in Turkey, Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, needled him by replying, “Come see the Apple Cloth” with a trademark logo.(Mr. Musk’s company is also not shy about testing the strength of its brand and the fealty of its customers. Tesla’s website offers a company-branded “handblown” decanter for $150 and a $60 umbrella with an “ergonomically designed handle.”)Technically, the cloth is not a new product. Apple had previously provided it free for customers who bought one of its high-end monitors, Pro Display XDR. The $5,999 display has a special type of glass that reduces glare, but may scratch if wiped with a conventional cloth. Apple said it designed its own cloth for that special glass and decided to sell the product separately when some customers asked to buy extras.An Apple official said in an interview, based on the condition that The New York Times not quote or identify her, that the company was not surprised by the demand for the Polishing Cloth. The official said the cloth was very effective and had been designed to be special, including a custom light gray color. Apple said the cloth was made of a nonwoven microfiber but declined to elaborate.Federico Viticci, editor in chief of MacStories, a website dedicated to Apple news and apps, said he initially thought the Polishing Cloth was a joke.“I’ve been cleaning my iPhone screen and my iPad screen with the cloth that comes with my eyeglasses or my T-shirt, or a paper towel like normal people,” he said.But Mr. Viticci, who is based in Italy, said he ended up buying the Polishing Cloth because “I kind of realized the meme potential here.” His tweets about the product have since gotten hundreds or thousands of likes and retweets, with subscribers to his site asking for exclusive cloth photos.Patrick Tomasso, 32, a Toronto-based YouTube creator of tech and photography-related videos, said he also thought that Apple charging $25 Canadian dollars for the cloth was “ridiculous” since many tech products include a microfiber cloth free.But when he noticed that it was not shipping until next year, he said he got a “bit of FOMO” — fear of missing out — and quickly snapped up two sheets from a nearby Apple store. As a spoof, Mr. Tomasso then made an “unboxing video” of himself opening the “most revolutionary Apple product.”In the video, he noticed that the Polishing Cloth’s color looked different in person — more gray, less white — and that there was a big crease in the middle that might n","A $19, 6-by-6.3-inch cloth is made with soft, nonabrasive material to clean iPhones, iPads",her siri show me someone who's got more money than sense,I have an iPhone but my god Apple hardos are sad,Negative Surprise Sadness,Negative Sadness Disgust,Apple launches cloth for $19
CNN,apple,14,"Apple says it will soon provide parts, tools and manuals to anyone who wants to fix an iPhone or a Mac.",https://t.co/25fVuU1oa9?amp=1,"Apple said it would soon provide parts, tools and manuals to those who wanted to fix their own iPhones and Mac computers.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Brian X. ChenApple delivered an early holiday gift on Wednesday to the eco-conscious and the do-it-yourselfers: It said it would soon begin selling the parts, tools and instructions for people to do their own iPhone repairs.It was a major victory for the “right to repair” movement, which has demanded that tech manufacturers provide the necessary components and manuals for customers to fix their own smartphones, tablets and computers.Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and others have long fought proposed legislation that would make such repair resources publicly available. But the movement gained momentum this summer when the Federal Trade Commission announced that it would ramp up law enforcement against tech companies that made it difficult to fix their gadgets.For decades, the idea that people could maintain their own consumer electronics has been impractical. Genuine parts were difficult to obtain, and repairs could be expensive and intimidating. When phones and computers broke, buying new ones was the simplest option.Now Apple’s self-repair program is a sign that the tech industry could finally be warming to making maintenance a part of the experience of owning a gadget.“It’s a win for repair shops, it’s a win for consumers, and it’s a win for the planet,” said Nathan Proctor, a director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization that worked on the “right to repair” legislation.Here’s what this means for you.Starting early next year, Apple said, people can use an online store to order parts and tools to mend its newer products, including the iPhone 12 and 13 and recent Mac computers. Customers who send in their broken part to Apple will receive credit toward the purchase of a new part.The program will focus on the most common items that need fixing, such as screens, batteries and cameras, before expanding to other types of components.The company has not yet published a list of costs for parts, but said the prices for consumers would be what authorized repair shops paid. Currently, a replacement iPhone 12 screen costs an authorized shop about $234 after a broken screen is traded in. At an Apple store, repairing an out-of-warranty iPhone 12 screen costs about $280.“Creating greater access to Apple genuine parts gives our customers even more choice if a repair is needed,” Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said in a statement.In short, you will have more options to mend an iPhone, which can bring your costs down.Previously, it was easiest to visit an Apple store to get an iPhone fixed. But just as taking your car to a dealer for servicing isn’t the cheapest option, going to an Apple store also wasn’t the most cost-effective.The alternative was to take your iPhone to a third party for repair, potentially for a more competitive price. When I took a broken iPhone XS screen to an Apple store this year, I was quoted $280 for the repair, compared with $180 from an independent outlet.Yet Apple has made iPhone repairs increasingly difficult for third-party shops, said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, a company that sells parts and publishes instructions for consumers to repair their electronics.Even when genuine parts were used, some repairs could be authenticated only with Apple’s software tools, which were not available to the public. Apple provided those software tools only to its staff and authorized repair shops that signed a contract and agreed to buy parts solely from the company. These authorized shops were then more likely to charge higher prices than unauthorized ones.Apple’s new program opens more doors. You could try fixing your device yourself to save cash. Or you could buy the parts from Apple and take them to someone else to do the repair.All of this may encourage people to maintain their products for longer and hold on to them, similar to doing regular maintenance on a car. That has implications for reducing technology waste and helping the environment.Apple was historically one of the most vocal opponents to the “right to repair” movement. The company cited security risks — like a customer’s data being hijacked during an unauthorized repair — as a primary reason to keep parts and instructions out of public reach.For non-Apple customers, this news is thus significant. If Apple, one of the world’s most valuable public companies, is setting a new standard with repairs, you can expect other tech manufacturers to follow — especially if they want to avoid fines from the federal government.“This announcement marks significant progress toward securing our right to repair, and we’re proud of Apple for making this bold move,” Mr. Wiens said.Advertisement","Apple said it would soon provide parts, tools and manuals to those who wanted to fix their own iPhones and Mac computers.

The lawsuit is the second of its kind — Facebook sued the NSO Group in 2019 for targeting its WhatsApp users.",https://t.co/JB2rjFS6k7?amp=1,"Apple accused NSO Group, the Israeli surveillance company, of “flagrant” violations of its software, as well as federal and state laws.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Nicole PerlrothSAN FRANCISCO — Apple sued the NSO Group, the Israeli surveillance company, in federal court on Tuesday, another setback for the beleaguered firm and the unregulated spyware industry.The lawsuit is the second of its kind — Facebook sued NSO in 2019 for targeting its WhatsApp users — and another consequential move by a private company to curb invasive spyware by governments and the companies that provide their spy tools.Apple, for the first time, seeks to hold NSO accountable for what it says was the surveillance and targeting of Apple users. Apple also wants to permanently prevent NSO from using any Apple software, services or devices, a move that could render the company’s Pegasus spyware product worthless, given that its core business is to give government clients full access to a target’s iPhone or Android smartphone.Apple is also asking for unspecified damages for the time and cost to deal with what the company argues is NSO’s abuse of its products. Apple said it would donate the proceeds from those damages to organizations that exposed spyware.Since NSO’s founding in 2010, its executives have said they sell spyware to governments only for lawful interception, but a series of revelations by journalists and private researchers have shown the extent to which governments have deployed NSO’s Pegasus spyware against journalists, activists and dissidents.Apple executives described the lawsuit as a warning shot to NSO and other spyware makers. “This is Apple saying: If you do this, if you weaponize our software against innocent users, researchers, dissidents, activists or journalists, Apple will give you no quarter,” Ivan Krstic, head of Apple security engineering and architecture, said in an interview on Monday.“Thousands of lives were saved around the world thanks to NSO Group’s technologies used by its customers,” an NSO representative said in a statement Tuesday. “Pedophiles and terrorists can freely operate in technological safe-havens, and we provide governments the lawful tools to fight it.”The NSO Group has dealt with a series of critical setbacks. This month, the Biden administration, in a notable breach with Israel, blacklisted NSO and Candiru, another Israeli surveillance company, saying they supplied spyware to foreign governments that used it to target the phones of journalists, dissidents, human rights activists and others.The ban, which means that no American organization can work with NSO, is the strongest step any American administration has taken to bring the global marketplace for spyware to heel.The Israeli government, which approves any sale of NSO’s software to foreign governments and considers the software a critical foreign policy tool, is lobbying the United States to remove the ban on NSO’s behalf. NSO has said it would fight the ban, but the executive set to take over NSO Group quit after the business was blacklisted, the company said.One week after the federal ban, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected NSO’s motion to dismiss Facebook’s lawsuit. The Israeli firm had argued that it “could claim foreign sovereign immunity.” A 3-to-0 decision by the court rejected NSO’s argument and allowed Facebook’s lawsuit to proceed.Those developments helped pave the way for Apple’s lawsuit against NSO on Tuesday. Apple first found itself in NSO’s cross hairs in 2016, when researchers at Citizen Lab, a research institute of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, and Lookout, the San Francisco mobile security company now owned by BlackBerry, discovered that NSO’s Pegasus spyware was taking advantage of three security vulnerabilities in Apple products to spy on dissidents, activists and journalists.And the company is at risk of default, Moody’s, the ratings agency, warned. Moody’s downgraded NSO by two levels, eight levels below investment grade, citing its $500 million of debt and severe cash flow problems.NSO’s spyware gave its government clients access to the full contents of a target’s phone, allowing agents to read a target’s text messages and emails, record phone calls, capture sounds and footage off their cameras, and trace the person’s whereabouts.Internal NSO documents, leaked to The New York Times in 2016, showed that the company charged government agencies $650,000 to spy on 10 iPhone users — along with a half-million-dollar setup fee. Government agencies in the United Arab Emirates and Mexico were among NSO’s early customers, the documents showed.Those revelations led to the discovery of NSO’s spyware on the phones of human rights activists in the Emirates and journalists, activists and human rights lawyers in Mexico — even their teenage children living in the United Stat","Apple accuses the NSO Group, the Israeli surveillance company, of flagrant violations of its software, as well as federal and state","This is an amazing admission on Apple's part.

The U.N. official shared with Reuters some of the options being suggested.The delivery of U.S. dollars to Afghanistan has stopped since the Islamist militants seized power and if countries or international financial institutions don't step up then the United Nations might have to fill the gap, said the official.One suggested option is using Afghanistan International Bank, which could bring in and store money, but there are issues with insurance, the U.N. official said.The United Nations is also aware that no one option will work and several avenues to get enough cash into Afghanistan are needed, the official said.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for the International Monetary Fund to agree on waivers or mechanisms to get money into Afghanistan. The IMF has blocked the Taliban from accessing some $440 million in new emergency reserves.Much of the Afghan central bank's $10 billion in overseas assets have been frozen as well, most of it in the United States. The U.S. Treasury has said there are no plans to release the money.""We need to work together to make the economy breathe again and to help people survive,"" Guterres said on Wednesday.

He said no women teachers had been laid off, and that this was ""a positive message to the world that we are working on a mechanism. We are not working on deleting them from our schools and universities.""However, Hashimi also said that education, like other areas of government, had been hit hard by the abrupt withdrawal of foreign support following the collapse of the Western-backed government in August and he appealed for aid to be restored.""If they truly want to see girls in schools, they ought to help us now,"" Hashimi said.While education spending had been increasing slowly under the last government, a UNESCO report said that external aid represented almost half the education budget in 2020.As well as the issue of girls' education, Hashimi said the ministry was working on a new curriculum for schools to bring them into line with the principles of Islam, local culture, and international standards.""The changes will be according to international standards in physics and chemistry and biology and all these science subjects,"" Hashimi said, adding that no changes had been made yet to the curriculum.He said ministry officials had been working closely with international agencies, which he said had reacted positively to the parts they had seen.However, he cautioned that the system would be set up in a manner that would be agreeable the Taliban leadership and scholars, and not based on international pressure.""We want to educate, and we will educate, our women and men – boys and girls.""","Afghan government says it will announce good news soon on older girls returning to school.

Earlier another spokesman said one of the attackers was captured.The blasts add to a growing list of attacks and killings since the Taliban completed their victory over the Western-backed government in August, undermining their claim to have restored security to Afghanistan after decades of war.There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the operation was typical of the complex attacks mounted by Islamic State. It follows a string of bombings by the group which has emerged as the biggest threat to Taliban control of Afghanistan.A Taliban security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least 25 people had been killed and more than 50 wounded in the assault but there was no officially confirmed casualty toll.Among the dead was Mawlawi Hamdullah Mukhlis, head of the Kabul military corps and one of the first senior Taliban commanders to enter the abandoned presidential palace when the city fell, Taliban officials said.Photographs shared by residents showed a plume of smoke over the area of the blasts near the former diplomatic zone in the Wazir Akbar Khan area of the city.Witnesses said at least two helicopters flew over the area as the assault went on, one of the first times Taliban forces have used aircraft captured from the Western-backed government in a military operation.Smoke billows near the Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan National Military Hospital after an explosion in central Kabul, Afghanistan November 2, 2021.

UNDP said that if the banking system fails, it could take decades to rebuild.The UNDP report said that with current trends and withdrawal restrictions, about 40% of Afghanistan's deposit base will be lost by the end of the year. It said banks have stopped extending new credit, and that non-performing loans had almost doubled to 57% in September from the end of 2020.""If this rate continues of non-performing loans, the banks may not have a chance to survive in the next six months. And I am being optimistic,"" al Dardari said.Liquidity has also been a problem. Afghan banks heavily relied on physical shipments of U.S. dollars, which have stopped. When it comes to the local afghani currency, al Dardari said that while there is about $4 billion worth of afghanis in the economy, only about $500 million worth is in circulation.""The rest is sitting under the mattress or under the pillow because people are afraid,"" he said.As the United Nations seeks to avert famine in Afghanistan, al Dardari also warned about the consequences of a banking collapse for trade finance.""Afghanistan last year imported about $7 billion worth of goods and products and services, mostly foodstuff ...

But the negotiations are ongoing, another source said, and the terms of the agreement, which has not been finalized, could still change. The briefing comes as the White House is still trying to ensure that it can carry out counterterrorism operations against ISIS-K and other adversaries in Afghanistan now that there is no longer a US presence on the ground for the first time in two decades after the NATO withdrawal from the country.The US military currently uses Pakistan's airspace to reach Afghanistan as part of ongoing intelligence-gathering efforts, but there is no formal agreement in place to ensure continued access to a critical piece of airspace necessary for the US to reach Afghanistan. The air corridor through Pakistan to Afghanistan may become even more critical if and when the US resumes flights into Kabul to fly out American citizens and others who remain in the country. The third source said that an agreement was discussed when US officials visited Pakistan, but it's not yet clear what Pakistan wants or how much the US would be willing to give in return.With no formal agreement currently in place, the US runs the risk of Pakistan refusing entry to US military aircraft and drones en route to Afghanistan.A Pentagon spokesman said the Defense Department does not comment on closed briefings due to security classifications. CNN has reached out to the National Security Council and Pakistan Embassy in Washington for comment.Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement saying ""no such understanding was in place,"" and that ""Pakistan and the U.S. have longstanding cooperation on regional security and counter-terrorism and the two sides remain engaged in regular consultations.""The State Department declined to comment.Uzbekistan and Tajikistan 'long shot' options for over-the-horizon operationsAt the same time, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are emerging as the top options for possible locations to establish a US military presence to conduct so-called over-the-horizon operations in Afghanistan, the sources said, but both would run into severe opposition from Russian President Vladimir Putin and some local politicians. ""Both are long shots,"" one source said, calling them ""likely pipe dreams due to needing Putin's blessing.""Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman visited Uzbekistan earlier this month where she discussed ""the way forward in Afghanistan"" with President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, according to a readout of the meeting.Currently, the US conducts its over-the-horizon operations from bases in the Middle East, forcing drones to fly from distant bases, such as those in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, around Iran and through Pakistani air space before reaching Afghanistan. The lengthy flight limits the time drones can loiter over Afghanistan gathering intelligence, and the Biden administration has been looking for closer, more effective options.The commander of US Central Command, Gen. Frank McKenzie, told lawmakers last month that he still has ""the ability to look into Afghanistan,"" but it is ""limited."" McKenzie also said he was not confident in the US' ability to prevent ISIS and al Qaeda from using Afghanistan as a launchpad for terrorist activity in the future.""The US maintains ongoing ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) capabilities as needed to support the over-the-horizon and counter-terrorism mission requirements,"" a defense official told CNN.

CNN,afghanistan,2,"The US govt.'s Afghanistan watchdog blasted the State and Defense depts. for withholding critical information about their work in Afghanistan that ""almost certainly would have benefited Congress and the public in assessing whether progress was being made.""",https://t.co/NGXTKfdK5C?amp=1,"By Ellie Kaufman and Oren Liebermann, CNNUpdated 9:21 PM ET, Fri October 29, 2021  (CNN)The US government's Afghanistan watchdog blasted the State and Defense departments for withholding critical information about their work in Afghanistan that ""almost certainly would have benefited Congress and the public in assessing whether progress was being made.""CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction John Sopko said, ""The full picture of what happened in August -- and all the warning signs that could have predicted that outcome -- will only be revealed if the information that the Departments of State and Defense have already restricted from public release is made available.""Speaking at the Military Reporters & Editors Association Annual Conference in Arlington, Virginia, on Friday, Sopko called on the two departments to release all the relevant information.Sopko has been a consistent and harsh critic of the way the Afghan war was conducted but his comments on Friday are likely to be scrutinized as lawmakers investigate the mistakes made in the conduct of the nearly 20-year conflict and its chaotic end. He said the restriction of information by the Defense Department, which he said dated back to 2015, would have helped Congress and the public assess ""whether we should have ended our efforts"" in Afghanistan.The Defense Department restricted the public release of information about ""the performance of the Afghan security forces,"" which included ""casualty data, unit strength, training and operation deficiencies, tactical and operational readiness of Afghan military leadership, comprehensive assessments of Afghan security force leadership and operational readiness rates,"" Sopko said.In short, he said, it was ""nearly all the information you needed to determine whether the Afghan security forces were a real fighting force or a house of cards waiting to fall."" The Pentagon had repeatedly touted the size and strength of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces as superior to the vastly outnumbered Taliban. In the end, the Afghan military collapsed in a span of less than two weeks as the Taliban swept across the country this summer, culminating in the fall of Kabul on August 15 with barely a shot fired.Sopko also ridiculed the State Department's request to ""temporarily suspend access"" to all ""audit, inspection and financial audit... reports,"" on SIGAR's website shortly after Kabul fell to the Taliban in August. The State Department claimed information in those reports ""could put Afghan allies at risk.""Sopko said State Department requests did not make senseThe requests, Sopko said, did not make any sense, like asking to redact the name of former Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani, a figure already well known internationally.""I'm sure [former] President Ghani may wish to be excised from the annals of history, but I don't believe he faces any additional threats, nor is there any threat to any other Afghans, by mentioning his name in our reports,"" Sopko quipped.State also asked SIGAR to consider redacting the name of a USAID official, Sopko said, even though he testified publicly before Congress in 2017 and video of the testimony is still available.State then requested SIGAR redact 2,400 new items the department identified on SIGAR's website. Sopko reviewed the requested redactions and found all ""but four to be without merit,"" he said.""Due to safety and security concerns regarding our ongoing evacuation efforts, we requested some reports be temporarily removed to redact identifying information from public records and protect the identities of Afghans and Afghan partner organizations. SIGAR has the authority to restore the reports when it deems appropriate,"" a State Department spokesperson told CNN in a statement. ""The identifying information are the only details intended to be shielded. Because of the volume of information, some entities temporarily removed reports or full datasets."" In late August, CNN requested reports from SIGAR and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) that were no longer available on the website. At the time both offices said they had removed the reports ""out of an abundance of caution"" at the request of the State Department.Sopko said the request from the State Department along with the Defense Department's longstanding restriction on key information about the mission in Afghanistan prevent lawmakers, the press and the public from knowing the true state of affairs in the country and what led to its collapse to the Taliban in such a short amount of time.Sopko argued State and Defense ""should declassify and make available to SIGAR and Congress all internal DOD and State Department cables, reports and other material reflecting the security situation on the ground over the last few years -- especially those reports that differed from the public statements of the agencies in Washington.""In order to fully understand what happened in Afgh",Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction John Sopko blasted the State and Defense departments.

IS Khorasan (ISIS-K), an ISIS affiliate that operates in central Asia, claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement posted on Telegram, ISIS' news agency, Amaq News,claimed that five of ISIS-K fighters were involved in the attack. One of the fighters detonated a suicide belt amidst a gathering of Taliban fighters at the hospital's external gate, the statement said. The Telegram post said the other fighters stormed the building and shot at Taliban members.  A doctor treating incoming patients at the nearby Wazir Akbar Khan civilian hospital said at least 15 wounded people had been admitted to his facility's emergency ward, several in critical condition. In addition, the Italian humanitarian NGO ""Emergency"" tweeted that nine injured were brought to its hospital in Kabul.Three armed men were seen inside the compound of the hospital near the entrance of the building after two blasts rocked the area, according to footage posted on Facebook and obtained by CNN. The video was filmed from inside the hospital by a man who wrote on Facebook he was ""trapped"" inside a room and in hiding. In the video, a fourth man appears laying on the floor.Photographs shared by residents showed a plume of smoke over the area of the blasts and witnesses said at least two helicopters were flying over the area, Reuters reported.  A health worker at the hospital, who managed to escape, told Reuters he heard a large explosion followed by a couple of minutes of gunfire. About ten minutes later, there was a second, larger explosion, he said. He said it was unclear whether the blasts and the gunfire were inside the sprawling hospital complex.There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But the official Bakhtar news agency quoted witnesses saying a number of fighters from the Afghan affiliate of ISIS entered the hospital and clashed with security forces, Reuters reported.The Daoud Khan Military hospital has been targeted before. In 2011, suicide bombers linked to the Taliban blew themselves up inside the facility, killing six people and injuring 26 othersIn 2017, ISIS-K, as the affiliate is known, mounted a complex attack on the hospital, killing more than 30 people.

Similarly, men on screen must wear ""proper clothes,"" although the guidelines do not specify which types of clothes are considered ""proper.""

Anyone can read what you share.By Azi PaybarahIn an effort to eradicate polio and boost health measures for children in Afghanistan, the Taliban government has agreed to restart a door-to-door vaccination program next month, and will allow women to be frontline workers in the drive, health officials announced on Tuesday.The announcement, by the World Health Organization and United Nations Children’s Fund, is a breakthrough in a country that has been called the “world’s polio capital,” a place where vaccinators have faced the twin challenges of a lack of access to patients and deadly violence.The five-day nationwide program to distribute the polio vaccine, which is given orally and in multiple doses, will begin Nov. 8, according to officials. The drive aims to reach about 10 million children, according to Dr. Hamid Jafari, head of polio eradication for the W.H.O.’s eastern Mediterranean region.More than 3.3 million children had previously “remained inaccessible to vaccination campaigns,” according to the statement announcing the drive. Children who are 6 months to 59 months old will also be given vitamin A supplements during the campaign, officials said.Word of the agreement comes as the Taliban have been showing some limited flexibility in dealings with the outside world as the government seeks desperately needed aid amid an ailing economy and increasing food scarcity.“We welcome W.H.O.’s effort to launch its polio vaccination campaign in Afghanistan and are ready to help and coordinate,” Bilal Karimi, a Taliban spokesman, said. “Women can also participate in this campaign and work closely with health workers to provide vaccinations to our people.”In addition to this polio vaccination program, set to start in early November, “all parties have agreed on the need to immediately start measles and Covid-19 vaccination campaigns,” the statement from the United Nations and W.H.O. said. A second polio vaccination program in Afghanistan will be synchronized with one in neighboring Pakistan that is scheduled to begin in December, it said.Half a dozen more vaccination programs are scheduled to begin next year, according to Dr. Jafari.In announcing the vaccination program, health officials said the Taliban “expressed their commitment” to allow women to be frontline workers in the drive and “for providing security and assuring the safety of all health workers across the country.”Dr. Jafari said that tens of thousands of women were expected to work in the vaccination effort, as vaccinators, supervisors and managers.The announcement comes after several attacks on polio vaccinators this year, stifling efforts to inoculate children against the disease. In June, at least five members of two polio vaccination teams were killed in one day during separate attacks in Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan. In the same city, three women working for the government’s polio vaccine campaign were shot dead in late March.“UNICEF is outraged by this attack,” the organization said at the time of the March killings. “Frontline health workers should never be a target of violence.”Around the same time of the shootings, there was an explosion at the city’s regional hospital, near the compound where the vaccines are stored, officials said.While no group took responsibility for these attacks, the Islamic State Khorasan, also known as ISIS-K, was active in the east and had claimed responsibility for similar attacks on women and civil society leaders in the area.The Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August, two decades after the American-led invasion of the country drove the group from power. The new government has committed to providing protection to health care workers.Health officials welcomed the Taliban’s support for the program. In the past, the movement expressed skepticism of door-to-door vaccination drives, saying they believed some vaccinators acted as spies in certain parts of the country. Elsewhere, the Taliban allowed vaccinators to carry out their work in districts under their control.“We’ve been working with them for decades,” Dr. Jafari said, noting that the Taliban had controlled large parts of the country during their exile from power. The Taliban “have always been supportive of polio vaccination and eradication,” he said.Dr. Ahmed al-Mandhari, the W.H.O.’s regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean, said, “The urgency with which the Taliban leadership wants the polio campaign to proceed demonstrates a joint commitment to maintain the health system and restart essential immunizations to avert further outbreaks of preventable diseases.”Restarting this vaccination program, said George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF’s regional director for South Asia, is “a step closer toward achieving ",Taliban leaders also agreed to allow women to be frontline workers for the effort.

She moved out of her house in Kabul and went into hiding as she sought ways to leave Afghanistan with her husband and three young daughters.“I lost my job and now I can’t even go outside or do anything freely because I fear these freed prisoners,” Nabila said by phone from a safe house. “A dark future is awaiting everyone in Afghanistan, especially female judges.”More than 200 female judges remain in Afghanistan, many of them under threat and in hiding, according to the International Association of Women Judges. Taliban officials have recovered their personal information from court records, several former judges said, and some have had their bank accounts frozen.“They are women who had the effrontery to sit in judgment on men,” said Susan Glazebrook, president of the judges’ association and a justice of the Supreme Court in New Zealand.“The women judges of Afghanistan are under threat for applying the law,” she added. “They are under threat because they have made rulings in favor of women according to law in family violence, custody and divorce cases.”The plight of female judges and lawyers is one more example of the Taliban’s systematic unraveling of gains made by women over the past two decades. Female judges and lawyers have left the courts under Taliban pressure, abruptly erasing one of the signal achievements of the United States and allied nations since 2001.The women have not only lost their jobs, but also live in a state of perpetual fear that they or their loved ones could be tracked down and killed.“Afghanistan is an open-air prison for these women,” said Kimberley Motley, an American lawyer who has worked in Afghanistan for several years. She said she is representing 13 female lawyers and judges who are trying to leave the country.A Taliban spokesman, Bilal Karimi, said no decision had been made about a future role for female judges and lawyers.“Right now, they are on hold,” Mr. Karimi said.But the judges and lawyers say they have been effectively fired because it is too dangerous for them to continue their work, given the Taliban’s disapproval of women who sit in judgment of men.With the departure of the U.S. military on Aug. 30, Afghanistan quickly fell back under control of the Taliban. Across the country, there is widespread anxiety about the future.“Women judging men is anathema to the Taliban,” Justice Glazebrook said.Before the Taliban takeover, more than 270 female judges served in Afghanistan’s corrupt, male-dominated justice system. Special courts with female judges, along with special police units and prosecution offices, were set up in many places to handle cases of violence against women. A little more than a decade ago, nearly 90 percent of women experienced some form of domestic abuse in their lifetime, according to a 2008 study by the United States Institute of Peace.These judges helped to bring some reform to many courts, particularly in urban areas, delivering justice to growing numbers of women and girls beaten and abused by husbands or male relatives.The women defied a legal system that favored husbands, granting divorces to Afghan wives who in many cases would previously have been doomed to stay in abusive marriages. Among those now in hiding are former lawyers and judges who defended abused women or pursued cases against men accused of beating, kidnapping or raping women and girls.Now many former judges and lawyers said their relatives or neighbors have been beaten or accosted by men demanding to know the women’s whereabouts.“We have lost everything — our jobs, our homes, the way we lived — and we are terrified,” said Wahida, 28, a former judge.Behista, 25, a former defense lawyer who represented victims of domestic abuse, said she had not left her home in Kabul since the Taliban takeover on Aug. 15. She is trying to leave Afghanistan with her mother and two brothers, one of them a former government soldier, she said.“I lost my job, and now my whole family is at risk, not just me,” Behista said.Nabila said she continued to receiv","More than 200 female judges remain in Afghanistan, many of them under threat and in hiding.

Anyone can read what you share.By Christina GoldbaumPhotographs by Kiana HayeriMAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan — When Narges and her younger sisters were finally allowed to return to school last month, they braced for the new world outside their family’s gate.Following their mother’s lead, each layered on a black dress, black abaya, head scarf and niqab, as well as a face mask. Minutes later, overcome by anxiety, Narges’ sister Hadiya, 16, fainted even before leaving the house. When Hadiya finally stepped outside and saw a Talib for the first time, tears poured down her face.Still, the girls consider themselves lucky. In Mazar-i-Sharif, a commercial hub in Afghanistan’s north, the Taliban have allowed middle- and high school-aged girls back into the classrooms, even as in the rest of the country most have been forced to stay home.Under pressure from foreign governments and international aid groups, Taliban officials insist that things will be different for girls and women from the last time the militants were in power, and that some form of education for them will be permitted, including graduate and postgraduate programs.Some middle and high schools have already been allowed to reopen their doors to girls in the north, where women have long played a more prominent role in society than in the Taliban’s southern heartland. The decision underscores how cultural differences are shaping the new government’s policies in different parts of the country.But many parents and teachers still have doubts that the move means the new government, which so far has kept women out of government and most public-facing jobs, will rule any different than before.“They may open schools, but indirectly they are trying to destroy women’s education,” said Shakila, Narges and Hadiya’s mother.When schools reopened to teenage girls last month, the news energized Narges, 17, a top student determined to become a surgeon. But it filled Shakila, 50, with dread.Shakila remembered crying for days after losing her job as a literature professor during the Taliban’s first regime, which barred girls from school and women from most public-facing roles in society. Even if her daughters could attend high school, she knew they would graduate into a country starkly at odds with their ambitions.With the departure of the U.S. military on Aug. 30, Afghanistan quickly fell back under control of the Taliban. Across the country, there is widespread anxiety about the future.On her daughter’s first day of class, she approached one of Narges’ teachers at Fatima Balkhi High School with an unusual request: Please, she said, make the girls less excited about their education.“This generation is fragile,” Shakila said, glancing at her daughter, Narges. Their last name has been withheld for their protection. “If she can’t go to university, she’ll be completely destroyed.”Already in Mazar-i-Sharif, the conditions for girls’ return are so restrictive that many are simply forgoing education altogether — an echo of the old order. New rules segregating classes and teachers by gender have exacerbated a severe teacher shortage and threaten to eliminate higher education opportunities for girls. Many parents have kept their daughters home, afraid to send them to school with armed Talibs lining the streets. Others no longer see the value of educating daughters who would graduate into a country where job opportunities for women seemed to disappear overnight.In Mazar-i-Sharif and Kunduz city, another major hub in the north where middle and high schools have reopened to girls, fewer than half of many schools’ female students have returned to classes, teachers say.During the first Taliban regime, in the 1990s, women and girls were barred from going to school. Those restrictions were lifted when the Taliban were toppled in 2001, and education opportunities for women gradually blossomed. By 2018, four out of 10 students enrolled in schools were girls, according to UNESCO.In urban centers like Mazar-i-Sharif, education became a vital pathway to independence for young women over the past 20 years, and schools the center of their social worlds.One recent afternoon at Fatima Balkhi High School, a flurry of teenage girls in black uniforms and white headscarves flooded the school’s hallways as students were dismissed from morning classes, their chatter echoing in the building’s marble atrium.By the front gate, a small group of girls struggled to tie the straps of their niqabs — the sheer black fabric blowing in the wind — while others pulled sky blue burqas over their heads as they prepared to leave the school grounds.

Individuals involved in the strike interviewed during this investigation truly believed at the time that they were targeting an imminent threat to U.S. forces on HKIA. The intended target of the strike, the vehicle, the white Corolla, its contents and occupant, were genuinely assessed at the time to be a threat to U.S. forces. That assessment was primarily driven by interpretation of intelligence and correlating that to observed movement throughout an eight-hour window in which the vehicle was tracked throughout the day before it was ultimately struck. Regrettably, the interpretation of the correlation of the intelligence to what was being perceived at the time, in real time, was inaccurate. In fact, the vehicle, its occupant and contents did not pose any risk to U.S. forces. In addition, the assessment prior to strike at the compound at which the vehicle was struck of the individuals in the area itself was inaccurate. The investigation found no violation of law, including the law of war — it did find execution errors confirmed by, or combined with confirmation bias and communication breakdowns that regrettably led to civilian casualties.

Two independent reviews that I conducted for this investigation, the physical evidence of a child was apparent about the 2 minute point. It is 100 percent not obvious. You have to be like, no kidding, looking for it. But when you’re looking for it, certainly after the fact, if you ask me, was there evidence of a presence? Yes, there was.”By Helene Cooper and Eric SchmittWASHINGTON — Surveillance videos showed the presence of at least one child in the area some two minutes before the military launched a drone strike on a site in Kabul, Afghanistan, in August, the Defense Department said on Wednesday.But the general who conducted the investigation into the U.S. airstrike, which the military has acknowledged mistakenly killed 10 civilians, including seven children, said the footage showing the presence of a child would have been easy to miss in real time.The inquiry by the Air Force’s inspector general, Lt. Gen. Sami D. Said, found no violations of law and does not recommend any disciplinary action. The general blamed a series of assumptions, made over the course of eight hours as U.S. officials tracked a white Toyota Corolla through Kabul, for causing what he called “confirmation bias,” leading to the Aug. 29 strike.“That assessment was primarily driven by interpretation,” the general said on Wednesday during an unclassified briefing on the report to news media at the Pentagon. “Regrettably, the interpretational assessment was inaccurate.”While General Said acknowledged that the military had video footage showing a child at the site two minutes before the launch, he said that he was unsure whether anyone who was not specifically looking for evidence of a child would have picked up on it.“Two independent reviews that I conducted, the physical evidence of a child was apparent at the 2-minute point,” he said. “But it is 100 percent not obvious; you have to be looking for it.”The military makes an effort to avoid civilian casualties. The known presence of a child in a strike zone would most likely have prompted, at a minimum, further consideration of whether a more thorough assessment of the target was warranted.With the departure of the U.S. military on Aug. 30, Afghanistan quickly fell back under control of the Taliban. Across the country, there is widespread anxiety about the future.Planners involved in the strike “had a genuine belief that there was an imminent threat to U.S. forces,” the general said. He acknowledged that was “a mistake” but added that “it’s not negligence.”General Said insisted that the strike has to be considered in the context of the moment, with American officials at a heightened state of alert after a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport three days earlier killed about 170 civilians and 13 U.S. troops.The investigation made several recommendations for fixing the process through which strikes are ordered, including putting in new measures to cut down the risk of confirmation bias and reviewing the pre-strike procedures used to assess the presence of civilians.Defense Secretary Lloyd J.

Anyone can read what you share.By Mujib MashalNEW DELHI — Security chiefs from Iran to Russia met on Wednesday in New Delhi to call for “unimpeded” humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan, where millions face starvation as a harsh winter sets in. On Thursday in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, another set of leaders urged “uninterrupted” aid.Despite agreeing to help Afghanistan, the souring relationship between India and Pakistan is getting in the way of 50,000 tons of Indian wheat reaching Afghanistan, officials say, in the latest sign that regional rivalries that have haunted the fragile country for decades continue to affect even the delivery of lifesaving assistance.Indian officials say Pakistan is dragging its feet on approving their request, made seven weeks ago, to move wheat and medicine through 400 miles of its territory to reach Afghans in need.But Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan, in a meeting on Friday with the Taliban’s foreign minister, said his government would “favorably” consider the Afghan request to allow the Indian wheat. Pakistani officials would not comment on why their response to India was taking so long, or when the transit could be granted.The World Food Program says that only 5 percent of the Afghan population has enough to eat, and that Afghanistan was already short on wheat by 2.5 million tons this year because of drought.Conflict and an economic collapse after the Taliban took over in August have only aggravated the problem. About 23 million people in Afghanistan face acute food insecurity, and nine million are on the brink of starvation, according to the World Food Program, a United Nations agency.“The humanitarian imperative must be separated from political discussions for the sake of the millions of Afghans in desperate need of food and emergency assistance as the harsh winter quickly engulfs the country,” said Mary-Ellen McGroarty, who heads the World Food Program’s operations in Afghanistan.In September, donors pledged more than $1 billion in aid to Afghanistan. But food needs alone require more than $200 million a month, and aid organizations are concerned about a funding shortage in the spring, when the number of people who are affected by hunger is predicted to peak. The wheat donation from India could fulfill 10 percent of the 500,000 tons of wheat the World Food Program requires for the period of January to May.Over the past two decades, as droughts led to repeated grain shortages in Afghanistan, India, which produces a grain surplus, often came to its aid. But relations between Pakistan and India have been consistently tense including over the disputed Kashmir region, and they plunged to a new low in recent years after deadly militant attacks in India were blamed on support from Pakistan.India has recently largely used the Chabahar Port in Iran to send wheat shipments to Afghanistan, a longer and costlier route. It has also turned to compacting wheat into high-protein biscuits to significantly reduce the tonnage.The Taliban’s return to power has further complicated the transit issues. Pakistan, where the Taliban found a haven during their 20-year insurgency, is now in many ways playing gatekeeper for Afghanistan.While many countries in the region had prepared for the possibility that the Taliban would return to power by hedging their bets with the group before the United States withdrew from Afghanistan, India continued to put its weight only behind the Afghan government. The sudden collapse of that government, with the Afghan president fleeing, left India with little leverage in a country where it had invested heavily over the past two decades.Even as India struggles to navigate the reality of the new Taliban-led Afghanistan, it responded to the U.N. agency’s appeal for assistance by preparing 50,000 tons of wheat. On Oct. 7, the Indian government delivered a letter to the Pakistani authorities highlighting the urgency of the matter and requesting help in “expeditiously” granting transit for wheat and medicine to go by road to Afghanistan, a senior Indian official said.Much of India’s grain comes from its north, particularly the state of Punjab, where the border crossing of Wagah is. Afghanistan is just a 400-mile drive across Pakistan from that crossing.In the seven weeks since India made its request for transit, calls for humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan have escalated, including at forums attended by officials from India and Pakistan. On the sidelines of an event last month in Moscow, Indian envoys met with Taliban representatives, and statements by the Taliban suggested that the offer of humanitarian assistance had been discussed.But there was no response from Pakistan t","Indian officials say Islamabad is dragging its feet on a request of transit for 50,000 tons of wheat to Afghanistan.

We’ll ruin the party,"" said Jean Michel Fournier, a fisherman from near Boulogne.Britain says it is respecting the post-Brexit arrangements while France says Britain is not honouring its word.A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain's position on issuing fishing licences hadn't changed and London was monitoring the protests.French fishermen block the 'Normandy Trader' boat at the entrance of the port of Saint-Malo as they started a day of protests to mark their anger over the issue of post-Brexit fishing licenses, in Saint-Malo, France, November 26, 2021.

CNN,brexit,2,"People in the UK think climate change, pollution and the environment are together the most important issues they face, well ahead of the pandemic, the impacts of Brexit and the National Health Service, according to a new poll",https://t.co/HTzH6g0GbQ?amp=1,"By Amy Woodyatt, CNNUpdated 4:24 AM ET, Wed November 24, 2021 London (CNN)People in the United Kingdom think that climate change, pollution and the environment are together the most important issues they face, well ahead of the pandemic, the impacts of Brexit and the country's troubled National Health Service, according to a poll from Ipsos MORI published on Wednesday.The poll showed the highest level of concern about the climate crisis since the agency began polling in 1988. Ipsos MORI publishes its poll monthly, and November's was carried out over a week during the COP26 climate conference. The event was held in Glasgow, Scotland, and received extensive national media coverage. Around 40% of people surveyed said climate change, pollution and the environment were among their top three concerns. The pandemic came second at 27% and Brexit was third, with 22%. Ipsos MORI interviewed more than 1,000 adults, who answered spontaneously and were not prompted with options as answers. Climate concern was 16 percentage points higher in November than October, when people expressed greater concern about Brexit, the pandemic and the economy. While there was a clear bump in interest during the COP26 conference, there has been longterm growth in concern about climate over the past decade, which has been confirmed by other polls, including from YouGov. The Ipsos MORI poll showed was a fairly even distribution of climate concern across age groups, genders and political affiliation.""[It's] very encouraging that climate change is no longer a preoccupation reserved to the young and the liberal,"" Gabriela Jiga-Boy, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Swansea, told CNN. ""It means that British society may not be very divided regarding climate change. This is very important in these times, when we discuss a lot about real or false polarization on issues, and we often exaggerate how polarized people actually are.""Climate a top concern for older people, tooMen and women considered the climate crisis a top issue almost equally, at 40% and 41%, respectively, the poll showed. And supporters of the center-right Conservative Party and center-left Labour Party were equal in their concern for climate issues.In the age group of 55 and over, 47% of people said it was a top issue. For the 35 to 54 age group, it was 43%. Among those 18 to 34 years old, just 27% said the same, though that age group was less likely to say they were worried about any particular issue.Ralitsa Hiteva, a senior research fellow in the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex Business School, said that climate change is now a top priority among a majority of groups because the topic is ""becoming personal."" That's also true for how policies like net-zero emissions targets may affect them.Dozens of countries have set a net-zero emissions goal for mid-century, for which they plan to drastically reduce greenhouse emissions and ""capture"" excess, through actions like planing trees or using technology to remove carbon from fossil fuels. Such technology isn't fully developed and remains controversial.  ""We are seeing that people are personally affected by things related to both the target for net zero, and are seeing and experiencing the impact of climate change -- from large wildfires to the rapid increases of the price of energy,"" Hiteva told CNN in an email.While concern about the climate crisis is fairly even among age groups, support for different types of climate action is more divisive.""Older people are more inclined to pay for investment in infrastructure to improve the experience of future generations,"" she said, adding that younger adults were less likely to do so.""The only way for this to translate into action is to use the momentum of the moment and engage people with re-imagining how infrastructure investment can be designed and used in an innovative way which is not only kinder to the environment but is also more inclusive and fairer.""","Poll from Ipsos MORI shows highest level of concern over climate crisis.

CNN,brexit,3,"Inside Boris Johnson's post-Brexit bubble, where he's king of his party but cut off from reality",https://t.co/mbFzAv9MIK?amp=1,"Boris Johnson should be in trouble. There are very real challenges to everyday life unfolding all over Britain.Drivers have been lining up at gas stations hoping to fill their cars, something made difficult by widespread fuel shortages. There are fears that that the cost of heating is about to surge, that more people will financially struggle to feed themselves, and that labor shortages will threaten food supplies at Christmas. And on the island of Ireland, there is legitimate concern that the British government is about to suspend part of the Brexit deal that prevents tension between the north and south. The fuel crisis was caused by a lack of truck drivers, a situation partially due to the Brexit that Johnson campaigned for. And there is plenty of evidence that the Prime Minister could have taken decisions months ago that would have avoided many of the wider problems. It stands to reason that the buck stops with the UK leader, and he should be under enormous pressure from his own supporters to fix things and keep the public happy. However, Johnson has proven time and again that, for him, the rules of conventional politics simply do not apply. His party faithful have gathered in the city of Manchester this week for the first time since Johnson won a landslide election, ""got Brexit done"" and ended Covid-19 restrictions in the United Kingdom. The mood here is celebratory.Celebratory moodWhatever is happening to citizens out there in the real world, the giddy bubble of the Conservative Party conference isn't just ignoring these myriad crises because they are inconvenient. The truth is that neither Johnson nor his party are under any real political pressure or suffering any consequences -- despite being responsible for many of these issues. Rather than reflect on the pandemic, considering ways to mitigate the impact Brexit is having on the economy or worrying about the opposition Labour party capitalizing on Johnson's blunders, Conservative party members appear to be making up for two years of being unable to celebrate Johnson's success. And it really does feel as though it is Johnson's success they are enjoying. Normally, conferences such as these focus on a series of talking points spread across government departments, showcasing the breadth of talent in the ministerial team. But this conference has really been about one thing: Johnson's at times ambiguous dream of ""leveling up"" the UK, which is about bringing poorer communities in line with wealthier areas in terms of quality of life, job opportunities and more. The logic behind this is straightforward: if Johnson can make life better in areas that don't have the same opportunities as some cities, most notably London, the resentment in those run-down areas toward the elite will be reduced, Johnson will be hailed a nation-unifying hero and he will tighten his grip on the UK's electorate. There are questions about how the PM plans to fund his ambitions. Yes, some members of his own cabinet have been outspoken about the government's idea to raise taxes in order to pay for things like social care. Others in the party, mostly traditional fiscal conservatives, are uncomfortable with the amount of state intervention and funding Johnson has seemed fine with during the pandemic. However, when these grievances are weighed against the fact that Johnson delivered the Conservative party its largest majority since the 1990s, it turns out that power at any cost apparently tastes better than losing with honor. One government minister told CNN on Monday night that ""fuel problems, food shortages, arguments over tax, all this stuff is definitely happening. But riding on his wave of success is ultimately just more fun."" Poor oppositionCNN asked multiple government officials, including cabinet ministers, why the very real problems facing the country were not being discussed at all. Their replies all pointed to the fact that -- as they see it -- if an election were held tomorrow, Johnson would win comfortably. ""The party, the members, we are all unified around a personality who keeps winning on his own terms. It's absolutely intoxicating to be part of,"" said one government official. The reasons for Johnson's success are most likely down to poor opposition on numerous fronts. Within his own party, he is an unrivaled king for the reasons outlined above. It's very rare for any party leader to face as little public dissent as Johnson does. Even ministers who were sacked in the most recent reshuffle are full of praise for their leader. Outside the gated conference in Manchester, the official opposition Labour party has also failed to make any real capital out of the recent crises plaguing the country. Even at their own party conference last week, Labour members were more focused on internal party politics than attacking an incumbent government that has been forced to call in the army to deliver fuel. Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Manchester, even offered to work with Johnson on h","There are real challenges to everyday life unfolding all over Britain.

CNN,brexit,4,The hard reality of Brexit is hitting Britain. It's costing everyone but Boris Johnson,https://t.co/GvW8x3A3lG?amp=1,"Analysis by Luke McGee, CNN BusinessUpdated 9:23 AM ET, Mon September 13, 2021 London (CNN Business)From one end of the supply chain to the other, the UK's food producers have endured a summer of trouble. ""The cold stores didn't have enough space to hold our crops, so we had to throw away a week's worth of production,"" explains Iain Brown, vice chairman of East Scotland Growers (ESG). ""And we've not had enough workers to harvest our vegetable crops, meaning they are going to waste."" While food shortages have been common in many countries over the course of the pandemic, Brown believes that one issue unique to the UK is making life extra painful: Brexit. According to Brown, the two essential prongs of production -- first, getting fresh food out of the ground, and then distributing it onto supermarket shelves -- are both taking a hit due to a lack of workers. First, a lack of truck drivers, who take fresh items like cauliflowers to and from freezing facilities, meant that the ESG cooperative at one stage had to throw away a week's worth of production, at an estimated cost of £1 million ($1.4 million). Second, Brown says that many of the seasonal workers, who would come from countries like Romania and Bulgaria for a few months to harvest vegetables, are now in short supply.""Some didn't come because the Covid regulations make it too hard; some came, made a lot of money, and went home earlier than planned."" This, Brown says, meant about 10-15% of his crop went to waste, costing around £200,000 ($277,000).It seems that the consequences of Brexit are finally being felt up and down the UK. And far from the sunlit uplands promised by members of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, a shortage of European workers in these vital areas means financial losses for businesses and empty shelves as the UK hurtles towards Christmas.The shortage of truck drivers is probably the most immediate issue. The current driver shortage is estimated to be between 90,000 to 120,000, according to a spokesperson for Logistics UK. While Brexit is not entirely to blame, the fact that the UK no longer has easy access to European drivers has created a headache for the industry. These people cannot simply be replaced by British workers. Besides the fact it can take up to nine months to qualify as a driver and cost up to £5,000 ($6,940) according to Logistics UK, Brits are not lining up to take these jobs. ""We have an aging workforce in the UK and the image of working conditions for lorry [truck] drivers -- unsafe parking spaces or places to rest up -- has made it unattractive for lots of younger people,"" a spokesperson for Logistics UK told CNN Business. This creates a hard choice for companies: What goods do you prioritize? If you have only one truck leaving your warehouse that day, you are probably going to prioritize perishables over things like bottled water. In the long run, this means less consumer choice and the possibility of consumer panic, as was seen in 2020 when Britain ran short on supplies of toilet paper.For some idea of how serious a problem is, the bosses of Britain's biggest supermarkets have described the food shortages as unprecedented -- one told The Times newspaper they were ""at a worse level than at any time I have seen"" -- and warned that shelves could be bare at Christmas due to a lack of drivers. These shortages should be a gift for Johnson's political opponents, who can say that his claims of having an ""oven ready"" Brexit deal in 2019 -- the promise on which he won a general election -- were false. The government, critics say, failed to adequately prepare for the inevitable consequences of Brexit and mitigate its initial impact. UK GDP growth ground to a near halt in July, according the Office for National Statistics, in part because of supply chain issues and worker shortages. Britain's economy remains 2.1% smaller than before the pandemic, and some economists think the difference won't be made up until the second quarter of next year.""Throughout the whole Brexit process the government found its efforts to get business and people prepared for the inevitable upheaval undermined by its need to present Brexit as something that would be positive for the UK and the economy,"" says Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform. ""This led to confusing radio adverts that didn't even mention the word Brexit, delayed guidance, and last-minute changes of heart."" Worse, Johnson's government is now in the strange position of refusing to implement a key part of the deal it once hailed as a great success. The UK was supposed to fully enforce a mechanism called the Northern Ireland Protocol later this year. The Protocol was agreed between the UK and EU to reflect the special status of Northern Ireland: Out of the EU, along with the rest of the UK, but sharing a soft land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state.

It’s unclear why that might have been at the moment.By Megan SpeciaAs world leaders prepare to meet for this weekend’s Group of 20 summit in Rome on some of the greatest challenges facing the global community, a dispute much closer to home for Britain and France is swirling in the background.A growing disagreement between the two countries over post-Brexit fishing rights in the English Channel has become a focal point for the summit and is expected to be a topic of discussion for the nations’ leaders.George Eustice, Britain’s environment secretary, told Sky News on Friday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was likely to raise the dispute with President Emmanuel Macron of France during the meetings. A spokesman for Mr. Johnson said the pair will meet briefly during the summit.Tensions have flared in recent weeks over fishing licenses. On Wednesday, France detained a British trawler near the port of Le Havre and fined two vessels. The French authorities have threatened further action beginning on Tuesday unless Britain issues licenses to dozens of French boats to operate in British waters.Speaking to reporters on the way to the G20, Mr. Johnson said that he was puzzled by the escalation, but that his government would do whatever was necessary to ensure Britain’s interests.“France is one of our oldest, closest allies and friends,” he said, according to the BBC. “The ties that bind us together are far stronger than the turbulence that currently exists in the relationship.”France has said that British failure to issue licenses to its fishing vessels would renege on a post-Brexit agreement. Clement Beaune, France’s minister for Europe, said in a statement that unless the licenses are issued, the country will consider other retaliatory measures, like limiting the electricity supply to the Channel Islands, British dependencies off the French coast.London has said that the French actions could violate international law. Liz Truss, Britain’s foreign minister, said in a statement that the government had summoned the French ambassador for talks on Friday “to explain the disappointing and disproportionate threats made against the U.K. and Channel Islands.”The dispute has become increasingly heated as the two nations try to navigate a new relationship after Britain’s exit from the European Union. The fishing dispute even resulted in a short naval standoff in May.Under a post-Brexit agreement forged in December, European fishers can continue to work in some British waters if they prove that they had worked in the area before Brexit, but France and Britain have locked horns over what documentation is required. Last month, Britain and the Channel Islands refused licenses to about 240 boats that the French authorities say have fishing rights under the agreement.France has threatened to add extra measures, including checks and controls on other goods entering Britain from French ports, raising fears of further disruption to Britain’s already struggling transportation industry.Advertisement",Tensions have flared in recent weeks over fishing rights in the English Channel.

Anyone can read what you share.By Stephen CastleLONDON — For months, a battle over the status of Northern Ireland has been the thorniest legacy of Brexit, even sparking a conflict known as the “sausage wars.” Now, Britain has upped the ante by demanding that post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland that it agreed to two years ago be scrapped and replaced.The European Union responded to that call Wednesday with a far-reaching plan to resolve practical problems raised by that Brexit treaty — the Northern Ireland protocol — that has provoked a full-scale confrontation between Britain and the bloc. It is a spat that could upset the United States.The protocol aims to resolve one of the most complex issues created by Brexit: what to do about the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland, which remains part of the European Union.According to the new proposal from Brussels, checks on food and animal products going from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland would be reduced by 80 percent, customs paperwork for shipments of many goods would be slashed and the flow of medicines would be ensured.“Today’s package has the potential to make real, tangible difference on the ground,” said Maros Sefcovic, vice president of the European Commission, the executive body of the 27-nation bloc, adding that this amounted to an “alternative model for implementation of the protocol.”But he offered no concession over a demand made on Tuesday by Britain for a completely new agreement, one that would remove any role for the European Court of Justice, the bloc’s top court, as an arbiter in disputes. That idea had already been rejected by Brussels.For critics of Mr. Johnson, the rift over the protocol is evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, his willingness to break international commitments and his denial of responsibility for the consequences of the withdrawal from Europe he championed. Mr. Johnson’s allies accuse the European Union of inflexibility in applying rules, a pettifogging lack of sensitivity to feelings in parts of Northern Ireland and vengeful hostility toward Britain for exiting the bloc.Behind all the bluster lie fears about the fragility of the Northern Ireland peace that raise the stakes beyond those of typical trade disputes. President Biden, who talks often about his Irish heritage, has already warned Mr. Johnson not to do anything to undermine the Good Friday Agreement that helped to end the violence.It’s fair to say that while the accord sounds like the title of a spy thriller, it’s actually a dry legal text that won’t be found on most people’s vacation reading lists.The frontier between Northern Ireland, which remains in the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which is in the European Union, is contested, and parts of it were fortified during the decades of violence known as “The Troubles.” But after the Good Friday peace deal in 1998, those visible signs of division have melted away along the open border. No one wants checkpoints back, but as part of his Brexit plan, Mr. Johnson insisted on leaving Europe’s customs union and its single market, which allows goods to flow freely across European borders without checks.The protocol sets out a plan to deal with this unique situation. It does so by effectively leaving Northern Ireland half inside the European system (and its giant market), and half inside the British one. It sounds neat — logical, even — until you try to make it work.The plan means more checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from mainland Britain, effectively creating a border down the Irish Sea and dividing the United Kingdom. Faced with all the new bureaucracy, some British companies have stopped supplying stores in Northern Ireland, saying they simply can’t handle the added paperwork now needed.This has enraged some Conservative lawmakers and inflamed sentiment among those in Northern Ireland who want the region to remain part of the United Kingdom. The unionists, mostly Protestants, identify as British and believe the changes could threaten their future in the United Kingdom.So while not being able to get the right kind of sausages might seem like a small inconvenience, to many unionists, it feels as if their British identity is what’s in the fryer.The bloc has dug in its heels, partly because Mr. Johnson signed on to the protocol, but also because he negotiated it himself and pushed it through the British Parliament.British critics accuse the Europeans of being overly rigorous and legalistic in their interpretation of the protocol, and of being overzealous about the checks required.But E.U. leaders believe that the bloc’s existential interests are being put at risk.

But experts are unsure that will help him stake out a post-Brexit role on the global stage.,https://t.co/FmbBBJ5vp6?amp=1,"U.K.’s prime minister makes headlines, yet experts say it is unclear if his lighthearted style is helping stake out a post-Brexit role on the global stage.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Mark LandlerLONDON — He told the world to grow up and accept the challenge of climate change. He made fun of France’s neuralgic reaction to being elbowed out of a submarine deal with Australia by Britain and the United States. He even cleared up lingering confusion about how many children he has (six).Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain cut a characteristically colorful swath from New York City to Washington this week, managing to travel between the cities by Amtrak — a nod to his Amtrak-loyal host, President Biden — before telling the aggrieved French to “prenez un grip” and “donnez-moi un break.”For Americans, now used to a president who rarely strays from the script, it was a throwback to a time when their own leader would show up in Britain and start lobbing cherry bombs. Except in the case of Donald J. Trump, that involved calling London’s mayor a “stone-cold loser” and telling a British tabloid that Mr. Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, was doing a bad job of negotiating a Brexit deal.Mr. Johnson has always been a more genial, upbeat figure, a journalist-turned-politician who uses humor, often at his own expense, to make serious points. What is less clear, after a five-day visit that featured signs both reassuring and problematic for the “special relationship,” is how the prime minister’s lighthearted style advances Britain’s effort to stake out a post-Brexit role on the global stage.“This is both Boris Johnson’s advantage and problem,” said Jonathan Powell, a former chief of staff to Prime Minister Tony Blair. “He’s great fun the first time you meet him. But the problem with being a comedy act is that you’re then not taken seriously. That’s why we weren’t consulted on Afghanistan.”Britain’s inclusion in a nuclear-powered submarine alliance with Australia and the United States was a notable victory for Mr. Johnson — one that showcased Britain’s relevance and compensated for the White House’s disregard of British views on the tactics or timing of the military withdrawal from Afghanistan.Still, it is a bright spot in a trans-Atlantic relationship that is otherwise a mixed bag. On the way to New York, Mr. Johnson told reporters that Mr. Biden had little immediate interest in negotiating a trade deal between the United States and Britain because he had “a lot of fish to fry.” Though hardly a surprise, his admission effectively buried one of the main selling points of Brexit: that it would enable Britain to cut a lucrative trade deal of its own with the United States.With Mr. Johnson seated next to him in the Oval Office a few days later, Mr. Biden also made clear that he would object to any British actions that threatened peace in Northern Ireland. Britain has vowed to overhaul its post-Brexit trading arrangements with the north, a process that critics say could jeopardize the Good Friday Agreement, which settled decades of sectarian violence there.British officials said Northern Ireland did not come up in their private talks, which one official characterized as “very warm.” But Mr. Biden’s public reference to it was a reminder that the issue has political resonance in Washington, and hence, continuing potential to disrupt the relationship between London and Washington.Prospects for a bilateral trade deal have now been replaced by hopes for something arguably even more far-fetched.British papers reported that the Johnson government is now mulling whether it could enter the revised North American Free Trade Agreement negotiated by Mr. Trump with Canada and Mexico. Since Britain already has deals with both countries, that would amount to a backdoor deal with the United States.Trade analysts were puzzled, noting that this would not spare either side the political hazards of a trade negotiation. Moreover, these experts said, the language in that deal, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, would be disadvantageous to British automakers eager to export to the United States.“Everything that makes a bilateral agreement difficult makes U.S.M.C.A. difficult,” said Sam Lowe, an expert on trade at the Center for European Reform, a research institute in London. “We’d still be talking about chlorinated chicken,” he added, referring to disputes over access for chemically treated American food.For Mr. Johnson, the complexities of a trade pact may matter less in the short term than the wins he scored. On the eve of his visit, the White House lifted a ban on travelers from Britain, the European Union and other countries, which had become a nagging source of trans-Atlantic strain.Mr. Johnson also got to crow over the submarine alliance, which not only makes Britain a key American ally in the geopolitical contest with China, but also h","Boris Johnson has always been a more genial, upbeat figure, a journalist-turned-politician who uses humor, often at his own expense",He’s just trying to get in good with ‘the new boss’…humor has a way of sanding down those rough edges.,The last place we want politicos is on the world stage: all but a very few are really bad actors.,Positive Trust Joy,Positive Joy,Opinion of Boris Johnson about Brexit

Anyone can read what you share.By Eshe NelsonLONDON — It began as a market stall in West Yorkshire, selling eggs and butter just before the turn of the 20th century.Today that market stall is Morrisons, Britain’s fourth-largest supermarket chain, with nearly 500 stores and the prize in a 7 billion-pound ($9.6 billion) bidding war between American private equity groups.It is a financial drama that is playing out almost weekly in Britain: A domestic company is courted and snapped up by, most likely, private equity investors awash with cash. Global investment companies have $1.3 trillion in dry powder (industry parlance for the unallocated capital), according to PitchBook, and they are eager to pluck bargains on British shores, where company valuations have been depressed by years of Brexit uncertainty and then disrupted by the pandemic.Already this year, 39 bids to take British companies private — just two shy of the total for 2020 — have been completed or proposed, half of them by private equity firms, according to Dealogic.“This year it’s all been unleashed,” said Richard Buxton, a fund manager at Jupiter Asset Management who has been investing in British stocks since the late 1980s.Among the deals: Blackstone picked up St. Modwen, a property company, and Signature Aviation, a private jet services business. KKR bought John Laing, an infrastructure firm. Carlyle’s bid for Vectura, an inhaler maker, came up short of one from Philip Morris, the giant tobacco company, to the chagrin of health campaigners.Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm, is bulking up in London, where it has more than 400 employees. Despite Brexit, it still sees Britain as a gateway to Europe and has invested nearly $20 billion in the country.“There is no shortage of opportunity” in Britain, said Lionel Assant, Blackstone’s head of European private equity.All this activity has raised concerns among some lawmakers who fear that too many British brands will fall victim to new owners willing to sell off assets.After the first reports that Morrisons was the target of a bid by New York-based Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, members of the Labour Party in Parliament wanted to know what could be done to protect a critical food supplier and its nearly 120,000 employees from the potentially harsher consequences of private equity ownership. Fears that Morrisons would be stripped of its assets and laden with debt, and its staff fired, quickly grew.More serious alarm bells have been raised about what’s happening in the defense industry, where foreign investors — corporate and private equity — are trying to buy British companies that work with the government. Two Ohio firms are jostling for Meggitt, which supplies parts for military planes and weapons systems. In early August, the British government said it was taking an “active interest” in the potential takeover.Two weeks later, the British business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, ordered the government’s competition watchdog to investigate a bid for Ultra Electronics, a British defense firm that supplies the Royal Navy, on national security grounds. The bid was by Cobham, a British firm that the American private equity company Advent took over in early 2020 and subsequently broke up.“The UK is open for business, however foreign investment must not threaten our national security,” Mr. Kwarteng wrote on Twitter.What makes British companies so appealing is their price. The price-to-earnings ratio, a measure of valuation, of the FTSE 100 index on the London Stock Exchange is far lower than that of the S&P 500. Returns on the index have lagged for years. In the past five years, the total return that investors got from the FTSE 100 was about 26 percent, compared with 125 percent for the S&P 500, according to Bloomberg data. And the British pound still hasn’t fully recovered from its post-Brexit drop.The most common answer for why British stocks are cheap, and therefore vulnerable to takeovers, is that there are just too few technology stocks.Tech sectors, and industries that are being digitized, are where much of the structural growth in global markets has come from in recent years, said Caroline Simmons, the U.K. chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.“We don’t have a great amount of that in the U.K.,” she said.Instead, indexes like the FTSE 100 rely heavily on companies in languishing industries that many investors are racing away from: traditional retailers, crisis-scarred banks, and mining and oil companies.It doesn’t help that Britons are already wary of private equity, having watched some of the country’s most popular restaurant chains and retailers be gobbled up over the past decade.

NYT,brexit,5,"On June 23, 2016, Britain voted to leave the EU. Brexit upended the country’s politics, divided its people and fundamentally altered its business environment.",https://t.co/yjWpny0T0S?amp=1,"What changed after Brexit Five years ago today, on June 23, 2016, Britain voted to leave the European Union. The separation has hardly been smooth, and in some ways the effects have yet to appear, Eshe Nelson, The Times’s London-based business reporter, writes for DealBook.  The Brexit vote upended Britain’s politics, divided its people and fundamentally altered its business environment.  Some of the fallout was immediate. The day after the referendum, the value of the British pound plunged the most in its history, setting off a period of rising inflation.  Other effects have emerged more slowly. In the past six months — after Britain formally left the bloc’s single market and customs union — the impact has been harder to discern through the turmoil of the pandemic.  ADVERTISEMENT  Continue reading the main story  After the vote, business investment stalled. Companies were too unsure about Britain’s major trading relationships to make big decisions. By the time there was any certainty, the coronavirus had hit British shores. Now, the government is planning a “super deduction” tax break to bolster investment. That could spur spending, but the underlying pace of growth is unlikely to return to its pre-referendum level.   Image  It’s too soon to unpick the overall impact on trade, especially for more than 180,000 British businesses whose only experience of international trade was with the E.U. New customs checks, veterinary requirements and other regulations have already restricted the movement of goods, and new agreements with far-flung countries aren’t expected to replace the deal Britain had with its nearest neighbors as a member of the E.U. By the government’s own estimates, its new trade deal with Australia will increase G.D.P. by as much as 500 million pounds (about $700 million) over 15 years, or 0.02 percent of output.  The financial services industry, one of Britain’s most prosperous sectors, resigned itself early to diminished status in Europe. This year, European shares and derivatives trading has shifted out of London, and banks are still moving employees to other European capitals. In response, the British government is trying to revive London’s reputation as a finance hub by overhauling rules on listings — welcoming SPACs, among other things — and loosening regulations for start-ups.  For many, Brexit was never about the economy; it was about immigration. Industries that relied heavily on European workers warned from the start about a looming labor crisis as it became harder for E.U. citizens to move to Britain. As the country recovers from the pandemic, that crisis has arrived.  Restaurants and hotels have been thwarted by staff shortages. There are warnings that there aren’t enough food production workers or truck drivers. Pandemic restrictions were a factor in foreign workers leaving the country, and industry groups are lobbying the government for exceptions to visa rules so that more chefs, truck drivers and butchers can be hired from the E.U., as they don’t expect those workers to easily return (or enough locals to step into the roles).  Britain’s last year in the bloc coincided with its worst recession in three centuries because of the pandemic. Recovering from Covid won’t be easy for any country, but businesses in Britain are also contending with the end of a four-decade economic union. It could be another five years, or more, before we know the true shape of Britain’s post-Brexit economy.","Five years ago, Britain voted to leave the European Union.

WP,brexit,1,"France threatens to cut off power to Jersey as U.K. sends in the Royal Navy, in post-Brexit spat over shellfish",https://t.co/DWrFA3inFW?amp=1,"LONDON — Just a day after the foreign ministers of the world's richest economies met at the G-7 summit here to applaud themselves for the return of international diplomacy, France and Britain found themselves sending gunboats to sea in a spat over shellfish.“We’re ready for war,” blared the Daily Mail tabloid in all caps. Not over bivalves, surely? But never underestimate the hot-button politics of fishing rights. It almost scuttled the Brexit trade deal between Britain and the European Union — and the aftereffects are still being sorted.As of Thursday morning, Britain had sent not one but two Royal Navy ships — the HMS Tamar and HMS Severn — to the little island of Jersey in the English Channel. Although it’s about 14 miles off the French coast, Jersey is a British Crown dependency, and Britain provides for its defense.France responded by deploying the Military Ops ship Athos to carry out a “patrol mission.” A second French vessel, the Themis, with the maritime service was also sent.Images of Jersey’s harbor of Saint Helier showed dozens of French fishing trawlers and dredgers bobbing in the waters inside and just beyond the port, firing smoke and flares.Josh Dearing, owner of the Jersey Catch fishing company, told the Press Association: “I looked from the shore this morning and it was just like a sea of red lights and flares already going off at sea. It was like an invasion.”The French fleet is angry because Brexit overturned previous agreements about access to shared fishing waters. Jersey is now requiring that skippers who want a license to rake the seafloor deploy the most modern equipment and also prove they have fished in the island’s waters in previous years — requirements that some captains complain are expensive or hard to fulfill.The French fisherfolk threatened to “blockade” the harbor, and they did stop cargo ships for a few hours from entering or exiting. English and Jersey fishing boats were also in the waters, creating the potential for conflict. In one scene captured on video, a French boat could be seen ramming another small vessel.But by Thursday afternoon, the French fleet had retreated, after a meeting with Jersey fisheries authorities, and Britain and France had called back their patrol ships. The BBC said that one of the Royal Navy vessels would return home Thursday night, and the other would depart Friday morning.In Paris, the Élysée Palace issued a statement Thursday evening saying that the “situation is currently calm and we hope it stays that way.”French Minister for the Sea Annick Girardin had suggested Tuesday that France would consider cutting off power to Jersey if fishermen were denied access to those waters.“Regarding Jersey, I remind you of the delivery of electricity along underwater cables,” she told lawmakers, noting that the island state gets most of its power from mainland France.“We’ll do it if we have to,” Girardin said, without going into details.But on Thursday night, the Élysée said such retaliation would be “a last resort.”Unlike in Britain, the rising tensions did not dominate the news in France on Thursday, with news channels and newspapers instead debating topics such as the complicated legacy of Napoléon Bonaparte.Speaking to Agence France-Presse, the junior minister for European affairs, Clément Beaune, vowed that France “won’t be intimidated” on fishing rights.He said he had earlier spoken to David Frost, the British cabinet minister responsible for relations with the European Union.“Our wish is not to have tensions but to have a quick and full application of the [Brexit] deal,” said Beaune.This is hardly the first time that British and French fleets have tangled. In a 2018 episode dubbed the “Great Scallop War,” the antagonists purposefully slammed into each other’s boats in another skirmish over fishing rights.But Brexit has opened new areas of conflict. And as Britain and France tussle over fishing rights, sustainability and quotas, the ministate of Jersey has been caught in the post-Brexit middle and muddle.Don Thompson, president of Jersey Fishermen’s Association, told The Washington Post that the French were deploying “intimidating and bullying tactics.”The threat to cut off electricity to the island, if carried out, would have huge consequences. “Hospitals would close, babies would die in hospitals. It’s not something taken lightly,” he said.Thompson described the scene Thursday morning: He said there were about 100 French trawlers sitting in the mouth of local harbor, and two British Royal Navy ships and a French patrol ship on the scene. “So there’s a little bit of tension.”He said the French boats were “stopping the food supply chain” as the “big ferry that sails between here and the mainland, carrying 95 percent of our food, is stuck in the port.”Thompson said that since the start of the year, French fleets have been “fishing in our waters, taking 100 tons of scallops every week, while our boats have been banned from landing the same scallops int",France and Britain sent two Royal Navy ships to the island of Jersey in a spat over fishing rights.

WP,brexit,2,Days of violence in Northern Ireland blamed in part on Brexit,https://t.co/f6Ux889BV3?amp=1,"BELFAST — A week of rioting reached new heights of intense violence in Northern Ireland with clashes overnight Wednesday that saw demonstrators hijack and torch a double-decker bus and battle police, who responded with plastic bullets.Police and politicians called it the worst violence in Northern Ireland in more than a decade, triggered in part by pro-British Protestant unionists who fear that their home is drifting away from Britain in the new realities of a post-Brexit world.When the nightly riots began across Northern Ireland a week ago, it was mostly young men and teenagers from unionist neighborhoods skirmishing with police. Some of those arrested were 13 and 14 years old.But on Wednesday, hundreds of Irish nationalist and unionist demonstrators began to face off, a worrying escalation that stirred old memories of the 30 years of sectarian violence known as the Troubles, which led to the deaths of 3,500 civilians, British security personnel and paramilitary members.On Thursday night, images on Twitter showed demonstrators gathering again in Belfast — some setting trash cans on fire and blocking streets — and police deploying water cannons.Saturday will mark the 23rd anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, brokered by the United States, which stopped decades of civil strife between Catholics and Protestants, and brought an end to the militarization of the borderlands between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to the south.At one of the “peace walls” separating traditionally Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods in Belfast on Wednesday night, the two sides hurled bricks and shot fireworks at each other across the barrier.One poignant image showed a masked young man throwing a firebomb across a locked gate that was covered with an old mural that read: “There was never a good war or a bad peace.”Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, appealed for calm and warned, “This needs to stop before somebody is killed or seriously injured.”“These are scenes we haven’t seen in Northern Ireland for a very long time. They are scenes that many people thought were consigned to history, and I think there needs to be a collective effort to try to defuse tension,” he told the Irish national broadcaster RTE.Dozens of police officers have been injured. Politicians representing unionist and nationalist sides have condemned the violence, even as they traded blame for the rioting.On Thursday, the leaders from both sides in the Northern Ireland Assembly issued a joint statement, expressing support for law and order and the police as well as grave concerns about “the scenes we have all witnessed on our streets.”Heightening the anxiety, it appears that paramilitary groups are now directing some of the violence, said Jonathan Roberts, assistant chief constable for the Police Service of Northern Ireland.“Last night was at a scale we haven’t seen in Belfast or further afield in Northern Ireland for a number of years,” Roberts told reporters. “We are very, very lucky no one was seriously injured or killed last night, given in particular the large number of petrol bombs thrown.”British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was “deeply concerned” by the clashes, especially attacks on police, a bus driver and a photojournalist. “The way to resolve differences is through dialogue, not ­violence or criminality,” he said Wednesday night.Members of the U.S. Congress and President Biden have warned Johnson that Brexit must not undermine the peace in Northern Ireland. On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called for calm. “We remain steadfast supporters of a secure and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a voice and enjoy the gains of the hard-won peace,” she said, adding: “We welcome the provisions in both the E.U.-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the Northern Ireland Protocol, which help protect the gains of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.”The sources of the week’s violence are varied, stirred by grievances old and new.Unionists and their politicians, who feel themselves a part of Britain, dedicated to queen and country, are upset with the Northern Ireland Protocol agreed upon by Johnson and his counterparts in the European Union to seal their Brexit deal.The emerging realities of trade after Brexit have given rise to complaints that Northern Ireland is being treated differently than Britain, with the movement of goods effectively controlled by new customs and controls across the Irish Sea.Unionists were also upset that up to 2,000 people came out to watch the funeral cortege in June for Bobby Storey, a former intelligence chief for the Irish Republican Army and a top figure in the nationalist Sinn Fein party.Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, demanded the resignation of the chief of police for failing to stop the gathering, which broke covid-19 lockdown restrictions.“Reasons for current anger are very complex,” said Justice Minister Naomi Long, leader of the A","Northern Ireland's foreign minister, Simon Coveney, appealed for calm and warned of the dangers of violence.

WP,brexit,3,"Boris Johnson's vision for post-Brexit ""Global Britain"" starts with more nuclear weapons",https://t.co/YiFa5K2AdN?amp=1,"LONDON — In a declaration of its aspiration to become ""Global Britain,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday unveiled his government's 10-year plan to boost international trade and deploy soft power around the world. But Johnson's government surprised many by declaring it would also increase its arsenal of nuclear warheads, not only to deter traditional threats but also to confront biological, chemical and perhaps even cyber assaults.In the sweeping review of its priorities for the coming decade, the 110-page document titled “Global Britain in a competitive age” declared that the U.K. would raise the cap on the number of nuclear warheads aboard the Royal Navy’s Trident submarines — from 180 to 260, an increase of more than 40 percent. The document also vowed to maintain a fleet of four nuclear-armed subs, so it would always have one at sea, ready to respond.The new goal appears to mark a profound shift away from Britain’s long commitment to nonproliferation. For decades now, Britain seemed content to reduce its aging nuclear arsenal, not bolster it.Britain has around 200 warheads, and past Conservative Party governments had pledged to reduce the number to 180 by the mid-2020s.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told reporters the country was not seeking a new arms race but simply wanted to maintain a minimal credible deterrence.“Why? Because it is the ultimate guarantee, the ultimate insurance policy against the worst threat from hostile states,” Raab said.The review released Tuesday, which was two years in the making, foresees a possible proliferation of nuclear weapons outside Britain, alongside advanced conventional weapons and “novel military technologies.”The document states that Britain “will not use, or threaten to use, nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear weapon state party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 1968 (NPT).” But it adds: “We reserve the right to review this assurance if the future threat of weapons of mass destruction, such as chemical and biological capabilities, or emerging technologies that could have a comparable impact, makes it necessary.”The British government said the increase in warheads was “in recognition of the evolving security environment, including the developing range of technological and doctrinal threat.”Experts reviewing the language said it suggests in the event of crippling biological, chemical, cyber or “dirty bomb” attacks of mass proportions, then Britain would consider a nuclear counterattack.Britain’s smaller political parties condemned the move. A Green Party member of parliament, Caroline Lucas, called the increase a “provocative, illegal and morally obscene use of resources.” The Scottish National Party tweeted: “A shameful sum of money that could be used to tackle child poverty instead.”Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said his party remains committed to the Trident submarine program and the maintenance of a credible deterrent, but he told the House of Commons that Johnson’s plan to increase the armory “breaks the goal of successive prime ministers and cross-party efforts to reduce our nuclear stockpile. It doesn’t explain, when, why, or for what strategic purpose.”Kate Hudson, the general secretary of U.K.-based Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said in a statement: “This is no time to start a new nuclear arms race. As the world wrestles with the pandemic and climate chaos, it beggars belief that our government is opting to increase Britain’s nuclear arsenal.”Hudson noted that President Biden and his Russian counterpart, Vladmir Putin, last month “agreed to further reduce their nuclear arsenals by renewing the New START Treaty.” The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy",Government unveils 10-year plan to boost international trade and deploy four nuclear-armed subs.

WP,brexit,4,"Brexit negotiators ""very gloomy"" over trade deal, with talks on ""knife’s edge."" Again.",https://t.co/MmaX4q4ONa?amp=1,"LONDON — According to the players, Brexit talks are ""on a knife's edge."" It's ""down to the wire."" It's ""crunchtime.""Sound familiar? It is. Even Brexit obsessives have lost track of how many “crunchtimes” have come and gone over these many years of negotiating Britain’s exit from the European Union.The political press is reporting a “final push” this week, but in reality, the sides have been pushing for a very long time.Though Britain officially left the E.U. in January, it didn’t quite leave. What it did was begin an 11-month transition period that ends at midnight on Dec. 31. That was supposed to give the sides time to craft a trade deal to continue the orderly movement of goods and services. It was supposed to avert the kind of last-minute chaos and uncertainty now unfolding.Negotiators met in London over the weekend and on Monday were back at it in Brussels. “Time is in very short supply,” said Jamie Davis, spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said “significant differences” remained after a conversation between them Monday evening. But a Downing Street spokesman confirmed that Johnson would travel to Brussels, the E.U. capital, later this week to try to close a deal.If they fail, Britain and Europe could soon see new customs duties, tariffs, border checks and quotas on goods — and an ignominious end to decades of free, frictionless trade.Britain crashing out without a deal could also undermine the open, invisible border between the Republic of Ireland, a member of the E.U., and Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom.President-elect Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have both warned Johnson not to do anything that could force a hard border to return to the island.But the specific sticking points of the talks appear far more narrow.The two sides are arguing over European access to fish in British waters, an emotional issue that taps into issues of sovereignty, even though the fisheries sector accounts for a tiny fraction of Britain’s gross domestic product.There have been proposals to slowly reduce the number of European fishing trawlers in British seas. Should the phaseout be three years (a British proposal) or 10 years (a French proposal)? Stay tuned.The Europeans, too, are pressing to maintain a “level playing field,” to stop Britain from undercutting worker protections and environmental safeguards, or granting state subsidies to British businesses, potentially giving U.K. companies unfair advantages over their European competitors.Meanwhile, the Johnson government on Monday pushed its controversial Internal Markets Bill through the House of Commons. The legislation is supposedly designed as a safety net to protect trade among England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. But its provisions break international law by reversing the original Brexit treaty signed last year.On Monday, the government offered an olive branch, saying it would ditch the controversial clauses in the bill if the two sides reach an agreement.Ireland’s foreign secretary, Simon Coveney, described the overall mood as “very gloomy.”The Irish minister told his state broadcaster, RTÉ, “I’d like to be giving more positive news, but, at the moment, these negotiations seem stalled, and the barriers to progress are still very much in place.”The British Foreign Office was a little less glum. Minister James Cleverly told the BBC the U.K. would keep negotiating “for as long as we have available time or until we get an agreement.” He said negotiations “often go to the last minute of the last day.”“We are a global player. We are one of the biggest economies in the world. We are a real prize for many countries,” Cleverly said, adding, “I think if the E.U. recognize this, they will see that actually making a few small but significant concessions can get this deal done and that will be in their interest and our interest.”Diplomats in Brussels, confronted with spiraling crises, say Brexit was long ago supplanted as their most burning issue.Nor is it even the trickiest negotiation they are facing in Brussels this week, amid acrimonious talks with two of the E.U.’s own members, Hungary and Poland. The two countries, whose commitment to democracy is increasingly shaky, have vetoed the entire $2 trillion E.U. budget because the other members want to make receiving funds conditional on adhering to the rule of law.E.U. issues its first rule-of-law report, angering leaders of Hungary and PolandBut even if Brexit is no longer at the top of the agenda, it is still urgent. Any deal would need to be approved by E.U. leaders and a handful of parliaments before Dec. 31.E.U. officials familiar with the negotiations said there was an agreement among themselves to halt talks Wednesday, regardless of their outcome, although such deadlines could easily be bargaining tactics.“It was always going to go beyond any reasonable deadline,” said one senior E.U. diplomat, who spoke","Talks on Britain's exit from the European Union are ""on a knife's edge,"" says Boris Johnson.

WP,brexit,5,Boris Johnson’s Brexit has a Joe Biden problem,https://t.co/ZfeJI7RUHB?amp=1,"This article is more than 1 year oldLONDON — During the height of the U.S. campaign, Britain’s former ambassador in Washington Kim Darroch revealed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his government were expecting — if not hoping — that President Trump would be reelected.Before months of pandemic changed the math, Downing Street was imagining that four more years of Trump would smooth the way for a fast-track free-trade deal with the United States just when Johnson needed it the most, as Britain exits the European Union at year’s end.But the win by former vice president Joe Biden has charged the “special relationship” between the two leaders and two closely allied countries with what the British might call a certain . . . awkwardness.Johnson and President-elect Biden have never met, and though the British prime minister sent his congratulations, the message was somewhat bungled. In the official tweet from Johnson’s office, there were faintly visible words in the text, a ghost of an earlier, edited message, that congratulated Trump instead.The goof was first spotted by the Guido Fawkes blog in Britain. The prime minister’s press office described it as “technical error,” explaining the government had prepared two different statements because the election was so close.Biden, for his part, called Johnson last year the “physical and emotional clone of Donald Trump” in private remarks widely reported in British press.Johnson could use a few friends these days. His aides are warring; England is in lockdown again; Britain continues to tally the highest death toll from the coronavirus in Europe. And the British prime minister still hasn’t secured a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union.But with Trump’s defeat, there’s no longer any reason for the Europeans to fear that Britain will get a quicker, better deal with the Americans. No longer can Johnson threaten Brussels negotiators — or calm his fellow Tories — with the feint: Okay, so long, mes amis, we will do better with the Yanks.Johnson is the chief cheerleader for Brexit. His legacy will be forever tied to the departure. Biden, however, has made no secret he thinks Britain’s exit from Europe isn’t a great idea, sharing the skepticism of his former boss, President Barack Obama, who traveled to London in April 2016 to give a speech urging Britain to remain in the European Union.This week, Biden included Johnson in the first round of calls placed by the former vice president to Western leaders, including those of France, Germany and, it did not go unnoticed, Ireland.In the call to Johnson, Biden stressed his support for the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Ireland, which was brokered by President Bill Clinton and ended decades of sectarian bloodshed. Biden emphasized the importance of implementing Brexit in a way that supports the still ongoing peace process, British officials said. In its readout of the call, Downing Street did not mention Northern Ireland.Biden has made a big deal of his Irish heritage. And alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), he has warned the British that there will be no U.S.-Britain trade deal if Brexit undercuts the free movement of people and goods in an Ireland where the old militarized land frontier between north and south has been removed, and the border today is invisible.Candidate Biden warned that “any trade deal between the U.S. and U.K. must be contingent upon respect for the agreement and preventing the return of a hard border.”Johnson has potentially upset that delicate balance with legislation to carry out his version of a Brexit, called the Internal Market Bill, which one of his own ministers called a violation of international law. In the event that Britain cannot strike a trade deal with the European Union, the bill would place a priority on the free flow of goods between Northern Ireland and Britain, which in turn could reintroduce border checks to the island — between the Republic of Ireland, a part of the European Union, and Northern Ireland, a part of Britain.In their 20-minute telephone call, Biden and Johnson sought common ground, “promoting global health security; pursuing a sustainable economic recovery; combating climate change; strengthening democracy, and working together on issues such as the Western Balkans and Ukraine,” according to the Biden transition team.But there is a question about how much Washington will need London in a post-Brexit world.Before Brexit, U.S. administrations could count on Britain to serve as an ally and proxy in Europe. But in a speech Tuesday in the House of Lords, former British prime minister John Major warned that Johnson’s Brexit makes Britain less important.“Suddenly, we are no longer an irreplaceable bridge between Europe and America. We are now less relevant to them both,” said Major, a member of Johnson’s Conservative Party.“We are a top second-rank power, but over the next half-century, however well we perform, our small size and population makes it likely we ",The win by former vice president Joe Biden has charged the'special relationship' between the two countries.

Wolf and Will MulleryVoters voted. States counted the votes. Challenges were heard and rejected. The Electoral College made President-elect Joe Biden's victory completely official.The time for President Trump's repeated baseless allegations of fraud is over, but that doesn't mean the drama has ended. Lawmakers follow an archaic timeline set out the Constitution and US law to make Biden president.Just as then-Vice President Biden oversaw the counting of electoral votes that gave Trump the White House in 2017, now it will be Vice President Mike Pence, Trump's loyal soldier these last four years, who will announce the vote tally that officially makes Biden the winner. Read more about that here.And Republicans will have to choose how deeply they want to follow Trump into his rabbit hole of conspiracy theories.Lawmakers will have the ability to raise objections about the vote — just like some Democrats did in 2017. But while those objections were dismissed easily in 2017, Republican senators could, if they choose, drag the process out this year, and force the House and Senate to vote on individual points.Here's a breakdown of what will take place next Wednesday, Jan. 6: From CNN's Lauren FoxThere will be no inaugural luncheon for President-elect Joe Biden on Capitol Hill due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a statement from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. JCCIC consulted with the Presidential Inaugural Committee in making the decision.CNN had reported a luncheon was unlikely, but this makes it official.From CNN's David Wright and Rachel JanfazaWith only days to go until the Jan. 5th Georgia Senate runoff elections, Democrats have begun closing in on what was previously a pronounced GOP ad spending advantage in the state.Ad spending is up to nearly $540 million overall for the consequential elections that will determine which party has control of the Senate. Republicans lead Democrats in total Georgia ad spending, including reservations since Nov. 10 and through the runoff by about $281.7 million to $256.6 million.The Democrats have raised money almost entirely through the strength of candidate advertising — Jon Ossoff has spent over $100 million in ads, while Rev. Raphael Warnock is at nearly $90 million, compared to about $53.7 million spent by Sen. Kelly Loeffler and $45.7 million for Sen. David Perdue, the Republican candidates. The campaigns and outside sponsors wasted little time to influence the two crucial contests after Perdue and Loeffler failed to hit the 50% threshold on Election Day, setting up elections against their Democratic challengers Jan. 5.When it comes to spending by outside groups on behalf of the candidates for Senate themselves, Republicans lead Democrats by nearly 3-to-1 — $180.5 million to $63.1 million.Major outside GOP donors include American Crossroads — the Republican super PAC founded by Karl Rove and Ed Gillespie, Senate Leadership Fund —a super PAC affiliated with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican — and Peachtree PAC, which despite the name suggesting homegrown roots, is an arm of the Senate Leadership Fund.Read more here.From CNN's Kate Sullivan and Arlette SaenzVice President-elect Kamala Harris is expected to receive the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine today, according to the Biden transition team.A transition official told CNN that Harris will be administered the vaccine live on camera from Washington, DC.

They went on their first date shortly after. ""It felt like we had known each other forever,"" after their first date, Emhoff, who will break a barrier himself as the first male spouse of a vice president, told CNN.""I didn't want it to end. And so the next morning, I pulled the move of emailing her with my availabilities for the next four months, including long weekends,"" he said.

CNN,kamala harris election win,4,"As Vice President, Kamala Harris ""will change what power looks like and directly influence whom it serves,""",https://t.co/5EckBz2XiI?amp=1,"Analysis by Brandon Tensley, CNNUpdated 1:41 PM ET, Wed January 20, 2021 Washington (CNN)Two weeks after a deadly insurrection put on display the White outrage that threatens the country's multiracial democracy, a dramatically different scene unfolded at the US Capitol.2020 showed the power of organizingHarris bursts through another barrier Why Kamala Harris' shoutouts to AKAs and HBCUs matter so muchWelcome to our reality, White AmericaThe racial politics of gun controlOn January 20, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were sworn into office.The inauguration of the first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president following the aforementioned assault did two things at once -- marked a hopeful turning point in the long fight for racial representation and justice, and underscored in sobering fashion that confronting White supremacy will be one of the new administration's main challenges.Harris' political rise even just over the past one and a half years is nothing to scoff at. Maybe most obviously, the former California senator's ascent to the vice presidency will change the face of power in a literal way.There was no shortage of coverage of how the 2020 Democratic primary field, which Harris was a part of, began as one of the most noteworthy in history. More specifically, the diversity of the slate of candidates who vied for the nomination was unprecedented: Latino, Asian, Black, gay, female. In December 2019, though, Harris suspended her campaign, as the field gradually congealed around straightness and Whiteness and maleness.It was no small thing, then, when Biden chose Harris as his running mate in August. ""It just feels like Black girls like me can run for class president. Black girls like me can go for the big things in life like she did,"" Paris Bond, a teenager, told CNN that month.Or as Harris' late mother used to say to her barrier-busting daughter: ""Kamala, you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you're not the last.""Just as moving: when the Democratic duo trounced Trump in the November general election. Propelled by a multiracial coalition, Biden and Harris not only thwarted the reelection campaign of a man who used his Whiteness as a weapon -- they also ended the perverse pageantry of an administration that embraced virulent masculinity.But as vice president, Harris will be able to offer more than symbolic representation.""Joe Biden's vice president will most likely be the most powerful vice president in history because the trend is toward more powerful vice presidents. Joe Biden knows the value of having a vice president with lots of responsibility, and Joe Biden is going to inherit an epic disaster,"" as former Barack Obama senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said last year, referring to the nightmarish toll of the novel coronavirus pandemic.Already, Harris has indicated how she'll battle the once-in-a-century crisis and its attendant racial disparities -- disparities that are the result of a history of discriminatory policy.Last May, she introduced the Covid-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force Act to ""bring together healthcare and other policy experts, community-based organizations, and federal, state, local, tribal and territorial leaders to confront the racial and ethnic disparities of this pandemic head on.""In December, Biden selected Marcella Nunez-Smith, an associate professor of internal medicine, public health and management at Yale University, to lead the health equity task force.""Health care free of racism and discrimination is a right and not a privilege,"" Nunez-Smith said during a web briefing last month. ""It is time for us to respond to the crisis of discrimination in health care.""In other words, Harris will change what power looks like and directly influence whom it serves.But even with those triumphal dimensions, the new administration, from the very beginning, will have to navigate the resurgent currents of White supremacy.In an interview with NPR last week, Harris didn't mince her words in her condemnation of the recent attack on the Capitol.""It was the same thing that went through my mind when I saw Charlottesville,"" she said. ""It's the same thing that went through my mind when I saw a picture of Emmett Till. It is not the first time I have seen a demonstration like what you are describing in the history of our country.""That Harris drew parallels between the horror of the Trump years and the brutality of decades past made sense. The seizure of the Capitol was a gruesome reminder that White supremacy has always been tightly stitched into the American fabric.Indeed, historians have noted how the takeover echoed the Reconstruction period in terms of White backlash to racial equality.For instance, in 1873, more than 150 armed White men -- most affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan -- murdered between 60 and 150 members of a Black militia that had been defending the Grant Parish courthouse in Colfax, Louisiana, following the state's bitterly contested 1872 gubernatorial","On January 20, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were sworn in as vice president.

Biden has been working on this speech for weeks with his team, including with his speech writer Vinay Reddy and senior adviser Mike Donilon, who has played a major role in crafting so much of Bidens messaging over the years. Biden is known to be a meticulous preparer for speeches big and small and has been known to make changes up until the last minute. We’ve also heard the President-elect talk about how he marks up his speeches to help with pacing. Sen.

CNN,kamala harris election win,6,BREAKING: Kamala Harris is sworn in as vice president of the United States. She is the first woman and the first person of Black and South Asian descent to hold the office,https://cnn.it/360yrzk,"By Meg Wagner, Melissa Mahtani, Melissa Macaya, Mike Hayes, Veronica Rocha and Fernando Alfonso III, CNNOur live coverage has ended. Read and watch below to see how the day unfolded. From CNN's Betsy KleinIn addition to executive actions and memoranda President Biden signed today, the Biden administration has an ambitious slate of additional actions for the first 10 days in office, many of which will roll back key policies established by his predecessor. Starting Thursday, each day through the end of the month, with the exception of this weekend, will center around a specific theme, with a set of corresponding actions and directives, according to a draft of a calendar document sent to administration allies and viewed by CNN.  Here are the themes: This Thursday, the theme of the first full day of the Biden presidency will be about coronavirus. There will be six executive orders and one presidential policy directive. The executive orders include things like a review of supply chain, additional data collection and transparency, and support for additional Covid-19 treatment research and supply. A presidential policy directive will call on agencies to “strengthen efforts to combat COVID-19 globally and strengthen global pandemic preparedness.” Then on Friday, the “Economic Relief” day, there will be two executive orders. One directs agency action on Medicaid, Pell grants, SNAP benefits and unemployment insurance. The second executive order will restore collective bargaining rights to federal employees and initiates action to roll back former President Trump’s Schedule F executive order – which gave the Office of Management and Budget and federal agencies leeway to reclassify key roles. From CNN's Leinz ValesAmanda Gorman, the United States’ first-ever youth poet laureate who recited a poem at the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, said the purpose of her poetry was not only to provide hope, but to show the power of words. ""To me, words matter, and I think that’s kind of what made this inauguration that much more sentimental and special,"" Gorman said. She continued: ""We’ve seen over the past few years the way in which the power of words has been violated and misappropriated. And what I wanted to do was kind of reclaim poetry as that site in which we can re-purify, re-sanctify, not only the Capitol building that we saw violated, but the power of words and invest that in kind of the highest office of the land.”Gorman talked about the importance of rebuilding and recovering in her poem today at the inauguration. Here's an excerpt of those lines:We will rebuild, reconcile and recoverand every known nook of our nation andevery corner called our country,our people diverse and beautiful will emerge,battered and beautifulWhen day comes we step out of the shade,aflame and unafraidThe new dawn blooms as we free itFor there is always light,if only we're brave enough to see itIf only we're brave enough to be itRead her full poem here.Amanda Gorman, the nation's first-ever youth poet laureate, shares one thing in common with President Joe Biden: They are part of the ""speech difficulty club,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper.Biden has a lifelong struggle with stuttering and has said that he ""still occasionally, when I find myself really tired,"" catches himself stuttering.Gorman said she had a speech impediment growing up and struggled to say the letter R.""So, for me, I use my self-expression to get my voice on the page,"" she said.To overcome her struggle, Gorman said she practiced spoken word and recited words out loud until she was able to teach herself how to pronounce the letters.She even used ""Hamilton""'s ""Aaron Burr, Sir,"" which is packed with Rs, for practice.""That's been a huge part of my speech pathology. It's why I included it in the inaugural poem. Also beyond that I think 'Hamilton' is such a great American cultural piece of what it means to be a better county. It was hard for me not to just copy and paste 'My Shot,' and email it the inaugural committee and be like here's my poem,"" Gorman said.She went on to share her personal mantra.""Whenever I perform — and I definitely did it this time — and I close my eyes and I say I'm the daughter of Black writers. We're descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world,"" Gorman said.See more:Poet Amanda Gorman said she used the insurrection on Jan. 6 as a form of inspiration for the poem she read earlier today during the inauguration of President Joe Biden.Read Gorman's full poem here.CNN's Anderson Cooper speaks with poet Amanda Gorman:A display of fireworks over Washington, DC, closed out today's Inauguration Day events.President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden are on the Blue Room balcony above the White House South Lawn watching the fireworks.

After turning to greet the former president, she softly pounded her gloved fists into Obama's, who had held up his own gloved hands moments earlier. The gesture was heavy with symbolism as Obama and Harris made history as the first African Americans to serve as president and vice president, respectively. After greeting the 44th president, Harris similarly fist bumped Michelle Obama, who had made history as the country's first African American first lady.Harris on Wednesday became America's first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president.The shared gesture with the Obamas was also a clear sign of the times: the inauguration took place as the coronavirus pandemic ravages the country. The virus has caused people to refrain from physically interacting too much with others, for fear that the virus could be transmitted during close interactions. The ceremony also contained a number of other coronavirus precautions, including face masks, socially distanced seating and a limited number of attendees. Following the ceremony, Harris joined President Joe Biden for a few planned inaugural events before she returned to the US Capitol to swear in three new Democratic senators: Georgia's Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, and California's Alex Padilla, her successor in the chamber. Harris will wield power as the Senate's crucial tie-breaking vote, helping the Biden administration confirm its appointments and giving Democrats the gavels of committees in charge of holding oversight hearings and crafting far-reaching legislation.",Kamala Harris sworn in as vice president as the first African Americans to serve as president and vice president.

The vice president praised the efforts of NIH and their scientists, saying that the work that they do to improve public health is an ""essential part of government.""""The importance of NIH is that this is about an essential function of government, which is to provide for the public health. The work that happens here has one goal, to improve public health. And the importance of the pursuit of the work that happens at NIH, is that it's not about profit. It's about the people,"" Harris said.

On Tuesday, the country recorded its highest Covid-19 death toll with 73 deaths in 24 hours, bringing the country’s total deaths to 2,477. The tiny eastern Mediterranean country leads the Arab world in the number of Covid-19 cases per million people. Tripoli is considered to be the poorest city on the Mediterranean coast, and has borne the brunt of Lebanon’s financial crisis. Khaled Kassab, a 24-year-old protester who took part during Monday’s protest, told CNN, “The protesters are back on the streets in Tripoli in particular and in Lebanon in general because of the deteriorating economic situation and the inflation.”  From CNN’s Larry Register More than 100 million people across the world have been infected by Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University. At least 100,032,461 cases of coronavirus have been recorded across the globe, according to Johns Hopkins.Countries reporting the most Covid-19 cases are:The United States makes up a quarter of all global cases, with well over 25 million coronavirus cases reported.Global deaths from coronavirus are over two million, with Johns Hopkins reporting at least 2,149,818 fatalities.Countries reporting the most deaths from coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins, are the United States, Brazil, India, Mexico and the United Kingdom.From CNN’s Chloe Adams Ireland's Prime Minister Micheál Martin announced new regulations to contain coronavirus, which include a 14-day mandatory quarantine for those traveling from South Africa and South America.A PCR test is designed to show whether a person has coronavirus.The regulations will apply to anyone traveling to any port or airport in Ireland, and came with a warning that policing under the new regulations will be increased significantly. Those in breach of the new law will also be subject to a fine of about $3,000 and possible imprisonment.“People should not be traveling and the government has made a number of d","Vice President Kamala Harris received her second dose of the same vaccine at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.

Harris’s Vogue cover set off an unexpected firestorm.  As the maelstrom of public hot takes began to swirl, Vogue released another, more formal portrait of Ms. Harris in a powder blue Michael Kors Collection suit with an American flag pin on her lapel, her arms crossed in a sort of executive power pose against a gold curtain — the “digital cover.” The journalist Yashar Ali wrote that this was the print cover Ms. Harris’s team had expected, and that, like the internet opinionators, her people were unhappy with the more casual shot. Vogue was seen as acting in bad faith. But according to people familiar with the arrangement, both scenarios had been agreed on in advance, from clothes to backdrops. However, while the portrait had been deemed the “cover try” (magazine-speak for the intended, but not definite, cover) and the standing shot conceived as the inside photograph, Vogue had not granted any kind of contractual cover approval rights to Ms. Harris. That meant Ms. Harris’s team had not seen the final choice, which was left to Vogue, and had not known the magazine had decided to swap the photos. Ms. Harris’s team declined to comment on what happened. The magazine released a statement: “The team at Vogue loved the images Tyler Mitchell shot and felt the more informal image captured Vice President-elect Harris’s authentic, approachable nature — which we feel is one of the hallmarks of the Biden/Harris administration.”","A leaked shot of Vice President-elect Kamala D.

She will become the first woman of color to be vice president on Wednesday, and will be sworn in by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first woman of color to sit on the Supreme Court.",https://t.co/G9tSZMO6FV?amp=1,"Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is now officially the former United States senator from California, after resigning from her seat on Monday, two days before her swearing-in as the No. 2 official in the executive branch.  “Today, as I resign from the Senate, I am preparing to take an oath that would have me preside over it,” Ms. Harris wrote in a farewell post to the citizens of her state before handing in her resignation paperwork on Monday and heading to a food bank, Martha’s Table, with her husband to fill bags of food for neighbors.  “As Senator-turned-Vice-President Walter Mondale once pointed out, the vice presidency is the only office in our government that ‘belongs to both the executive branch and the legislative branch.’ A responsibility made greater with an equal number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate,” she added.  During this time of national crisis and political rancor, Ms. Harris is transitioning into a far more important role in the upper chamber than she ever occupied as a representative of California — she has the tiebreaking vote in a Democrat-controlled Senate deadlocked at 50-50 with Republicans.  Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a fellow Democrat, will appoint a successor to Ms. Harris, who was elected in 2016. Mr. Newsom said last month that he intended to tap Alex Padilla, California’s secretary of state, for the seat. Mr. Padilla’s Senate term will expire in 2022, and he could seek re-election.  Ms. Harris continued to attend Senate sessions after her November election, and was in the Capitol for the certification of the election results this month when the building was stormed by a violent mob of Trump supporters.  Ms. Harris will be sworn in as vice president on Wednesday by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a ceremony in which the first woman of color to become vice president will take her oath from the first woman of color to sit on the Supreme Court.  Ms. Harris chose Justice Sotomayor for the task, according to a Harris aide who was confirming a report by ABC News. The vice president-elect and Justice Sotomayor have a shared background as former prosecutors. And Ms. Harris has called the justice a figure of national inspiration.  “Judge Sonia Sotomayor has fought for the voices of the people ever since her first case voting against corporations in Citizens United,” Ms. Harris wrote on Twitter in 2019. “As a critical voice on the bench, she’s showing all our children what’s possible.”  Justice Sotomayor, who was confirmed to the Supreme Court in 2009, swore in Joseph R. Biden Jr. for his second term as vice president in January 2013 (first in a private ceremony and again in public the next day because of a quirk of the calendar).","'I am preparing to take an oath that would have me preside over it,' she wrote in a farewell post on Monday.

The history-making moment is a milestone for Americans who have fought tirelessly for generations to see faces that resemble their own in the government’s executive branch.  But Ms. Harris’s role in the new administration will be much more than a symbolic one.  With the Senate now split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, Ms. Harris may find herself casting the decisive vote in many crucial moments, as the vice president wields tiebreaking power. Ambitious legislation on the coronavirus, the economy, climate change and other policy matters will be high on President Biden’s agenda, and her vote may prove critical. One of her first official acts in her new role will be to swear in three new Democratic senators.  Many expect Mr. Biden will also rely on her prosecutorial chops and her personal energy as a crucial member of the administration. And given speculation that Mr. Biden, who is 78, may not seek a second term, Ms. Harris is sure to face intense scrutiny over her own political future.  But for many, it’s the voice she will offer to women and people of color that was being reflected on as she took office.  “That’s so important, to have a Black woman, a South Asian woman’s perspective, on the big issues that this administration has to tackle,” said Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California and a longtime ally of Ms. Harris’s. “She’ll bring a justice lens, a racial justice lens, racial equity, to everything and every policy and every decision that’s going to be made.”  Across the country, women are wearing pearls on Wednesday to mark the occasion, a nod to the signature pearls that Ms. Harris has worn throughout major milestones in her life, and is likely to wear again when she is sworn in for her history-making turn as the first female vice president. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who as the first woman of color to serve on the Supreme Court has broken barriers of her own, administered the oath.

WP,kamala harris election win,2,"How sexist, racist attacks on Kamala Harris have spread online — a case study",https://t.co/cLnFdrtWWo?amp=1,"OpinionsFormer vice president Joe Biden’s history-making pick of a woman of color to share the Democratic ticket has been a popular decision. A Post-ABC News poll taken in the days after his selection of his former rival Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) found that a solid 54 percent of Americans approved, while only 29 percent had a negative opinion.But in the fetid corners of the Internet, a different set of plotlines took hold. A racist trope questioned whether Harris, a daughter of immigrants who was born in the United States, is constitutionally eligible to be vice president. Another suggested her heritage, which is Jamaican and Indian, disqualifies her from claiming she is Black.One pernicious line of attack on Harris is as old as misogyny itself. It claims that a woman who has served as San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general and U.S. senator slept her way into those positions.In the first week after Harris was named to the ticket, the sexualized hashtag #heelsupharris appeared 35,479 times in Twitter posts, according to an analysis by the media intelligence platform Zignal Labs. It also found that, immediately following the running-mate announcement, false claims about Harris were being shared at least 3,000 times an hour on Twitter.Raw numbers, however, do not get to the roots of these lies. So we have looked into one example. In this case, what started as an offensive post on one man’s personal Facebook page was seized upon and expanded by malicious actors, then blasted across the Internet. Ultimately, it would be seen more than 630,000 times on Twitter alone, adding fuel to sexist attacks being made on Harris by leading right-wing figures and even the president of the United States.The day after Biden announced his selection of Harris, a former California state assemblyman named Steve Baldwin wrote a post on his Facebook page that began: “I do remember Kamala Harris....” He recalled seeing her around Sacramento in the 1990s with Willie Brown, the assembly speaker, who was separated from his wife.That is false. Harris dated Brown, and he appointed her to two state boards, which may have been ethically questionable. But their relationship had been over for about eight years by the time Harris ran for her first elective office. During that campaign for district attorney in 2003, her past with Brown, who had by then become mayor of San Francisco, was used against her by her opponents. Harris described Brown as “an albatross hanging around my neck.”As it turned out, the attacks against her backfired. Harris won in a runoff with 56 percent of the vote, beginning a political rise that would see her elected three times statewide in the most populous state in the country.Baldwin, who sometimes writes for conservative websites, did not expect anyone beyond his Facebook friends to read his post. It got a modest 185 “likes.” But then something strange began happening.The post took on a life of its own, as Baldwin explains below:What Baldwin wrote underwent a transformation as it spread like a brushfire across the dry tinder of the digital ecosystem. It began carrying the headline “Steve Baldwin exposes Kamala Harris,” and identifying him as a former congressman, which he is not. Odd Web links were added. In some instances, so was a cartoon that depicted Harris engaged in oral sex. It was rewritten to include new opening paragraphs that accused Harris, who got married in 2014, of being an “opportunistic liar” when she spoke of her affection for the stepchildren who call her Momala. You can see some of these changes on the post below:The altered post showed up on dozens of right-wing blogs, on Facebook group pages and in comments sections. It also found its way to non-political sites that cater to people with such varied interests as day trading, biblical prophecy, firearms and the medical transcription field. A few examples below:Facebook, which appears to be the primary platform on which it spread, doesn’t make its analytics data transparent. But from the information that is available, there are signs that the metastasis of Baldwin’s post was not random.Mentions on disparate websites spiked over a short period during the first week of September, which was nearly a month after Baldwin wrote his original version. They were being generated from accounts with names such as “Here4money” on a stock-trading forum and “Big Boy” on a biker blog. “To see a cluster of identical posts on everything from a motorcycle forum to a pornographic Tumblr account suggests a behind-the-scenes coordinated effort by these pseudo-anonymous actors,” said Tim Chambers, the head of Dewey Digital, the digital and social media arm of the public affairs firm Dewey Square Group.The digital smear campaign reinforced a narrative about Harris that was already being pushed by prominent mainstream conservative commentators.

WP,kamala harris election win,4,Opinion: Vogue’s Kamala Harris cover shows that diminishing powerful Black women is still in fashion,https://t.co/N4xspCwwfq?amp=1,"In life, as in boxing, it’s often the punches you don’t see coming that knock you out.Once Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) was elected vice president in November, I was worried that the attacks on her power and position that we witnessed during the campaign would only increase. I expected as much from Trumpists and violent white supremacists. But it was Vogue’s insidious diminishing of Harris for its February print cover that knocked me over.The photo, leaked over the weekend, has been a topic of heated discussion for days. Shot by Tyler Mitchell, the first and still only black photographer to shoot a Vogue cover since his beautiful 2018 portrait of Beyoncé, the incoming vice president is pictured in her famous converse Chuck Taylor sneakers. She wears her street clothes, a dark espresso blazer and black ankle-length pants, and stands before a backdrop of pink and green drapes — the colors of her sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha. On her face is the expression of someone not quite ready for the camera.Notably, an alternate, online cover, widely shared, has Harris in a pale blue Michael Kors Collection suit, against a lighter gold backdrop. She is folding her arms and smiling. She looks pretty. It’s a much better photograph; it comes as no surprise that her team reportedly preferred it.But in the world of fashion, print cover choices matter. And in a world where strong Black women are often maligned as intimidating and unfeminine, the image Vogue chose reduced Harris just as she is taking her rightful place at the heights of American power.It’s frankly shocking that this is the direction the magazine went. Considering that Vogue, and the fashion industry as a whole, came under fire in 2020 for lacking diversity, one would think that major publications would go above and beyond to get Harris and her historic ascension right.Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour spoke to journalist Kara Swisher and explained that “all of us felt very, very strongly that the less formal portrait of the Vice-President-elect really reflected the moment we were living in” and that “a much less formal picture, something that was very, very accessible, and approachable, and real, really reflected the hallmark of the Biden-Harris campaign.”I wonder if she watched the same campaign I did. The key to the Biden-Harris victory was not “approachability;” it was the powerful antidote they offered to the incompetence and the racism of the Trump administration — specifically their vow to fight the twin scourges of racist division and covid-19. We didn’t need to see a diminished, approachable Harris wearing her Chuck Taylors. How about a competent, commanding Harris wielding her vice-presidential power? Or something with the breathtaking emotional appeal of the suffragist-inspired white pantsuit that Harris wore to celebrate victory in Wilmington, Del., on Nov. 7?This was not Vogue’s only recent misstep with photographing Black women — the recent badly-lit, unflattering cover photos of Simone Biles come to mind — but it’s not like taking a good photo of Black women in politics is some impossible task. Vogue itself has shot amazing cover photos of Michelle Obama, and Ethan James Green’s 2019 black-and-white portrait of Stacey Abrams for the magazine was stunning. Abrams was dressed in a dark colored power suit and heels. Unsmiling, she looks every bit the modern political general that she is.“What should have been a blissfully distracting, glossy celebration of a barrier-breaking moment has become a cause for disappointment,” my Post colleague Robin Givhan wrote. As Givhan pointed out, the cover feels like a thief that has robbed us of the opportunity to revel vicariously through Harris in Black female accomplishment.Black accomplishment in White patriarchal power systems is always fraught. Writ large, it’s Donald Trump winning the presidency after Barack Obama. But in incessant, exhausting smaller acts such as magazine photos, we are reminded of a truth about America: Black progress is often followed by backlash and the diminishment of our power and victories.That’s why this punch, intended as such or not, hurt so much. It was harm caused by thoughtlessness, a lack of care and attention to the power and significance of Harris’s rise and what it means to so many women like her. Black women are tired of bracing ourselves against harm. All we want is to be embraced for who we are.Considering that the Capitol was just attacked by Trumpist insurrectionists and the FBI has warned about threats against her, I know the vice president-elect has bigger things to worry about than a magazine cover. But I hope Vogue is listening to Black women when we say, when we win, give us our due. We deserve to be elevated as the powerful, competent leaders that we are.Read more:J.

WP,kamala harris election win,6,Capitol Police officer who faced down pro-Trump mob escorts Harris at inauguration,https://t.co/53D1McyloO?amp=1,"Eugene Goodman, the U.S. Capitol Police officer who faced down a mob of pro-Trump rioters during the attack on the U.S. Capitol building this month, escorted Vice President Harris at the inauguration.Goodman accompanied Harris in his role as the new acting deputy Senate sergeant-at-arms.A Black officer faced down a mostly White mob at the Capitol. Meet Eugene Goodman.After walking Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, from their motorcade, Goodman descended the steps of the Capitol and wheeled back to watch the entrance. Huge cheers erupted as he was announced to the crowd. He wore a beige overcoat, a lavender scarf and a black mask.“The man who saved the Senate,” Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.) tweeted. “Standing ovation and cheers for a true hero, Officer Eugene Goodman.”Selecting Goodman as Harris’s escort was a powerful acknowledgment of his actions on Jan 6. Footage of a lone Goodman, who is Black, facing down a group of mostly White rioters was widely shared after the attempted insurrection. In the clip, Goodman is shown trying to hold back dozens of rioters, moving swiftly up a flight of stairs as he appeared to lure the group away from the Senate chambers, where lawmakers and staff had taken shelter.Goodman’s quick thinking probably prevented a violent confrontation and may have saved lives, experts who reviewed the footage told The Washington Post.He is being considered by lawmakers for the Congressional Gold Medal, one of the highest awards a civilian can receive in the United States, for his bravery during the assault.President Biden made multiple references to the riot in his inaugural address Wednesday morning, saying the mob “sought to shake the Capitol’s very foundation.”“Here we stand, days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to stop the will of the American people,” he said. “It will not happen, not today, not tomorrow, not ever.”Goodman, 40, grew up in Southeast Washington and served in the Army from 2002 to 2006, deploying with the 101st Airborne Division to Iraq for a year. His awards include a combat infantryman badge, indicating he was in ground combat.Friends described him as a reserved and private person who was wary of the flood of attention that has come his way over the past two weeks. One friend said he had been in hostile firefights and had a reputation for staying calm during emergencies.As rioters converged on him in the Capitol, Goodman showed significant restraint and situational awareness, checking his surroundings and communicating with fellow officers on his radio while the mob pursued him. Some in the crowd wore symbols of the Confederacy and could be heard yelling “traitor.”Five people died in the attack, including one of Goodman’s fellow Capitol Police officers, Brian D. Sicknick. The 12-year veteran died a day after police said he physically engaged with the rioters.Rebecca Tan and Justin George contributed to this report.100 days: Harris tries to move from history-maker to Biden’s heir apparentTie breaker: No vice president has broken more Senate ties as early as Kamala Harris hasLetters to Kamala Harris: Reader letters to Vice President Harris ahead of the inaugurationKamala Harris’ most trusted adviser: Her sister MayaHer first race: How Kamala Harris learned how to become a political brawler.The first: Kamala Harris, a daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, has made history as the first woman of color elected vice president.The Second Gentleman: Doug Emhoff became the campaign’s ‘secret weapon’A Biden-Harris White House: Background on their families, policies and careersThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy",Eugene Goodman is being considered by lawmakers for the Congressional Gold Medal for his bravery during the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol building.,Eugene Goodman is an American hero.

WP,kamala harris election win,7,"Senate passes a budget bill with Vice President Harris casting a tie-breaking vote, paving the way for covid relief package",https://t.co/aiQ5xzIFi5?amp=1,"The Senate approved a budget bill early Friday that paves the way for passage of President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, with Vice President Harris casting the tiebreaking vote on the measure that will be key to enacting Biden’s first major legislative initiative.Passage of the budget bill by a 51-to-50 vote came just after 5:30 a.m. Friday, after an all-night Senate session during which senators plowed through dozens of amendments in a chaotic process known as a “vote-a-rama.” Democrats cheered on progress to address the pandemic, while Republicans complained of partisanship and excessive spending.The House, which approved its own budget bill on Wednesday, is expected to act on on the Senate’s version within a day.With the budget resolution nearly complete, Congress can turn in earnest to writing Biden’s expansive pandemic relief proposal into law — and push it through the Senate, without Republican votes if necessary, under the special rules unlocked by the budget legislation. That process will take weeks, with Democrats eyeing mid-March as the deadline for final passage of the relief legislation because that is when enhanced unemployment benefits will expire if Congress doesn’t act first.“With the passage of this resolution we have the opportunity not only to address the pandemic, to address the economic collapse, to address the reality that millions of kids have seen their education disrupted,” said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). “We have the opportunity to give hope to the American people and restore faith in our government to fight for them.”Stimulus FAQ: The new Democratic plan for $1,400 stimulus checksDespite Biden’s campaign promises of unity and bipartisanship, now that Democrats control both chambers of Congress and the White House they appeared ready to leave Republicans behind. Republican senators accused Democrats of hypocrisy and argued that, after already devoting $4 trillion to fighting the pandemic, including $900 billion in December, there was no need to spend another $2 trillion on what they termed a wish-list of liberal priorities.“This is not the time for trillions more dollars to make perpetual lockdowns and economic decline a little more palatable,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). “Notwithstanding the actual needs, notwithstanding all the talk about bipartisan unity, Democrats in Congress are plowing ahead. They’re using this phony budget to set the table to ram through their $1.9 trillion rough draft.”Under the Senate’s arcane rules, debate on the budget resolution in the Senate triggered a freewheeling amendment process known as a “vote-a-rama” that began Thursday afternoon and lasted for the next 15 hours, with some 45 amendments considered on a wide array of topics.Here’s what to know:Republicans used the opportunity to force Democrats to vote on politically tricky issues, some with little connection to the coronavirus. Even those amendments that were adopted would not have had the force of law — but they could show up in future political ads.One of the first amendments offered, by Blunt, sought to block funding for schools that have not reopened for in-person learning once teachers had been vaccinated. It failed on a party-line vote. An amendment by Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) aimed at ensuring state and local jurisdictions cooperate with federal law enforcement authorities also failed along party lines. Democrats blocked an amendment by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) aimed at opposing packing the Supreme Court, and one from Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) that sought to block stimulus checks from going to inmates.Two Democrats — Manchin and Jon Tester — joined with Republicans to approve an amendment by Daines aimed at overturning Biden’s move to block construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. There was greater bipartisanship on display on other votes, notably the 99-to-1 approval of the amendment by Manchin and Collins to ensure than high-income taxpayers do not get stimulus payments.The Senate voted unanimously in favor of an amendment by Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) aimed at providing tax relief to mobile health-care workers, and an amendment by Barrasso to compensate schools losing tax revenue due to Biden’s moratorium on oil and gas development on federal lands passed 98 to 2.Young offered an amendment he said was aimed at ensuring that undocumented immigrants do not receive stimulus checks. It passed 58 to 42, with eight Democrats voting in favor.Hours later, Ernst sought to advance an amendment saying the federal minimum wage shouldn’t be raised during a pandemic. To her apparent surprise, Sanders agreed with her, saying that his plan to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour — which Biden has included in his relief proposal — phases in over five years and doesn’t occur immediately. The Senate then adopted Ernst’s amendment on a unanimous voice vote.The Senate passage of the budget resolution moves the “budget",The Senate passed a budget bill by a 51-to-50 vote early Friday.

Reuters,andrew cuomo sex scandal,9,Woman who accused New York Governor Cuomo of groping her files criminal complaint - NYPost,http://reut.rs/3ytlhXS,"NEW YORK, Aug 6 (Reuters) - A former employee who accused New York Governor Andrew Cuomo of groping her in the Executive Mansion in Albany has filed a criminal complaint with the Albany County sheriff's department, the department said on Friday.The woman, whose name has not been made public, was an executive assistant who told state investigators that Cuomo groped her breast on one occasion. It is the gravest of the sexual harassment allegations faced by Cuomo, whose once ascendant political career as part of one of the country's most powerful Democratic Party families is on the brink of collapse.The former aide was one of at least 11 women who state investigators this week said were sexually harassed by Cuomo, a Democrat. The governor is resisting widespread calls to resign, including from U.S. President Joe Biden, and faces impeachment by state lawmakers.At a news briefing on Friday, lawyers defending Cuomo and his office argued that the investigation was biased from the start.""There has been no open-minded fact-finding in this case,"" said Rita Glavin, a lawyer representing Cuomo. ""The investigation was conducted to support a predetermined narrative.""The executive assistant told investigators that Cuomo called her to the mansion in November 2020, led her into a room, closed the door, slid his hand under her blouse and cupped her breast over her bra, according to the investigators' report, released on Tuesday by New York Attorney General Letitia James.Judith Olin, a law professor at the University of Buffalo and a former New York state prosecutor who specialized in sexual assault cases, said the assistant's allegations could support a charge of forcible touching, a misdemeanor, or potentially even a felony charge of sexual abuse. But she also said any prosecution could face an uphill climb given the lack of physical evidence and witnesses.James' report also concluded that Cuomo and his staff retaliated against at least one woman who complained about him by leaking her confidential employment records to the press. James said the governor had broken both federal and state laws forbidding sexual harassment in the workplace but that the investigation she oversaw was a civil one and that she would not be prosecuting.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo speaks during a news conference on COVID-19 vaccination at Suffolk County Community College in Brentwood, New York, U.S. April 12, 2021. Michael M. Santiago/Pool via REUTERSThe criminal complaint was first reported by the New York Post. A spokesman for the sheriff's office, who declined to give his name, confirmed that the woman filed a complaint.Cuomo, who has been holed up with advisers at the governor's mansion since the report's release, has conceded that he is affectionate with people he meets, but denies wrongdoing. His staff contacted Albany police in March when the woman's allegations emerged.""As we said previously, we proactively made a referral nearly four months ago in accordance with state policies,"" Richard Azzopardi, a Cuomo spokesperson, said in a statement.Glavin, Cuomo's lawyer, did not address the criminal complaint itself but said the executive assistant's accusation was false. Records show the woman was at the mansion on Nov. 16, 2020, but Glavin pointed to emails the woman sent while she was there that gave no indication anything untoward had occurred.""The documentary evidence does not support what she said,"" Glavin said.Cuomo's lawyers also criticized James for not releasing the transcripts of witness statements to investigators, which would allow them to examine the evidence directly.In response, Fabien Levy, a spokesperson for James, said, ""There are 11 women whose accounts have been corroborated by a mountain of evidence. Any suggestion that attempts to undermine the credibility of these women or this investigation is unfortunate.""The Albany County district attorney's office is one of several prosecutors around the state that have requested records collated by the attorney general's investigators, but would not confirm on Friday that a formal complaint had been filed.""This is an ongoing matter that is under review,"" Cecelia Walsh, a spokesperson for the district attorney, said in a statement.",Former employee of New York Gov.

Reuters,andrew cuomo sex scandal,11,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned after an inquiry found he sexually harassed 11 women, amid legal pressure and demands for his departure. Cuomo's resignation marks the second time in 13 years that a New York governor stepped down in scandal",https://t.co/ugpDn4JvVV?amp=1,"NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Faced with mounting legal pressures and demands for his departure from President Joe Biden and others, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned on Tuesday following an inquiry that found he sexually harassed 11 women, capping a startling downfall for one of the most prominent politicians in the United States.A Democrat who had served since 2011 as governor of the fourth most-populous state, Cuomo made the announcement a week after New York Attorney General Letitia James released the results of a five-month independent investigation that concluded he had engaged in conduct that violated U.S. and state laws.In a televised, 20-minute address, Cuomo, 63, said his resignation would take effect in 14 days, derailing a long political career that once appeared headed for a possible U.S. presidential campaign.Cuomo again denied any wrongdoing, though he said he accepted ""full responsibility"" for what he characterized as ill-conceived attempts to be affectionate or humorous.He said he had concluded that fighting the accusations while remaining in office would paralyze state government and cost taxpayers millions of dollars at a time when the coronavirus pandemic still poses a major threat.""I think, given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to government - and therefore that's what I'll do,"" he said.Cuomo's resignation spared him from possible removal from office through impeachment proceedings in the Democratic-controlled state legislature, which appeared overwhelmingly likely as lawmakers abandoned him in droves.The investigation, detailed in a 168-page report, found that Cuomo groped, kissed or made suggestive comments to women including current and former government workers - one a state trooper - and retaliated against at least one woman who accused him of sexual misconduct.Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, 62 and a Democrat from western New York, will take over as governor of the state of more than 19 million people until the end of Cuomo's term in December 2022 as outlined in the state constitution, becoming the first woman to hold the post.""I agree with Governor Cuomo's decision to step down,"" Hochul said in a statement. ""It is the right thing to do and in the best interest of New Yorkers.""Cuomo is the latest New York politician to leave in scandal. Eliot Spitzer quit as governor in 2008 over his patronage of prostitutes. The man who succeeded him, David Paterson, aborted his 2010 re-election campaign facing allegations of witness tampering and other offenses. U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 in a sexting scandal. In 2018, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned after four women accused him of abuse.Cuomo also became the latest powerful man taken down in recent years following the rise of the #MeToo social movement against sexual abuse and harassment that has shaken politics, Hollywood, the business world and the workplace.Lindsay Boylan, a former aide who was the first woman to accuse Cuomo publicly last December, wrote on Twitter that Cuomo had remained ""abusive"" until the end by attacking his victims.""My hope always has been that this will make it safer for other women to report their own harassment and abuse,"" she wrote.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo arrives to depart in his helicopter after announcing his resignation in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., August 10, 2021. REUTERS/Caitlin OchsCuomo was elected to three four-year terms as governor, as was his late father, Mario Cuomo. He previously served as secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development from 1997 to 2001 under then-President Bill Clinton.Like his father, Andrew Cuomo never ran for president despite speculation about his possible ambitions. He was hailed as a national leader last year early in the COVID-19 pandemic after delivering daily news conferences as his state became the U.S. epicenter of the public health crisis.The attorney general's civil investigation found that the actions of Cuomo and his senior advisers violated multiple state and federal laws, but James did not pursue criminal charges.Local prosecutors in Manhattan, Nassau County, Albany County and Westchester County, however, said after the report's release that they were looking into the matter and requested evidence from the independent inquiry.Last week, one of Cuomo's accusers, Brittany Commisso, filed a criminal report with the Albany County Sheriff's Office, alleging the governor groped her breast at the Executive Mansion in Albany last November. The sheriff told reporters his office would conduct a thorough investigation.Cuomo had for months denied escalating accusations of sexual harassment - and renewed those denials after the investigative report was issued. But what was left of his political support crumbled after the findings were made public. Hours later, Biden, a longtime friend, said he believed Cuomo should resign.","New York Gov.

Andrew Cuomo will receive more than $5 million from his book about leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic, tax records released on Monday show, a considerable sum for a project under scrutiny by the state attorney general's office. Cuomo's contract with publisher Penguin Random House for ""American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic"" awarded him $3.12 million, with an additional $2 million to be paid to him over two years, according to his senior adviser Rich Azzopardi. The Democratic governor donated $500,000 from his book deal to the United Way of New York State for pandemic relief and vaccination efforts and put the remaining money in a trust for his three daughters, Azzopardi said in a statement to CNN.The governor filed his 2020 financial disclosure, obtained by CNN, with the New York State Joint Commission on Public Ethics. The revelation follows a request last month from the New York state comptroller to the state attorney general, Letitia James, asking that her office investigate allegations that Cuomo used state resources in the ""development and promotion"" of his book. The letter to James asks her to specifically investigate ""indictable"" offenses related to the ""use of property, services or resources of the state for personal purposes, private business purposes or other compensated non-governmental purposes"" related to the drafting, editing, sale and promotion of Cuomo's book and any related financial or business transactions.""We won't comment further on an ongoing investigation at this time,"" James' spokesman said at the time. Azzopardi told CNN in a statement about the book last month: ""The idea there was criminality involved here is patently absurd on its face and is just the furthering of a political pile-on.""""This is Albany politics at its worst -- both the Comptroller and the Attorney General have spoken to people about running for Governor and it is unethical to wield criminal referral authority to further political self-interest‎,"" he said.But even before the probe, Cuomo's book about leadership during the pandemic faced a raft of backlash after a top aide said the administration delayed the release of data on Covid-19 deaths of long-term care facility residents because of concerns about a potential federal investigation by the Trump administration.

Andrew Cuomo is expected to face questions on Saturday from members of the New York state attorney general's office related to their investigation into sexual harassment allegations against him, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. The interview with Cuomo signals that the investigation could be nearing its final stages, though no timeline has been established. Following multiple sexual harassment allegations against the Democratic governor earlier this year, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced an investigation that would result in a public report. The two lawyers hired to lead the investigation for the attorney general's office, Joon Kim and Anne L. Clark, are expected to interview Cuomo in Albany, two people familiar with the matter told The New York Times.A senior adviser to Cuomo, Richard Azzopardi, told CNN in a statement Thursday, ""We have said repeatedly that the Governor doesn't want to comment on this review until he has cooperated, but the continued leaks are more evidence of the transparent political motivation of the Attorney General's review.""CNN has reached out to the New York state attorney general's office for comment.The allegations against the governor include one that emerged in a February New York Times article. Charlotte Bennett, a 25-year-old former executive assistant and health policy adviser to Cuomo, told the newspaper that during one of several uncomfortable encounters, Cuomo asked her questions about her sex life during a conversation in his state Capitol office and said he was open to relationships with women in their 20s.She interpreted the exchange -- which she said took place in June 2020, while the state was in the throes of fighting the pandemic -- as what the newspaper called ""clear overtures to a sexual relationship.""Another former aide, Lindsey Boylan, accused Cuomo of sexual harassment, including an unwanted kiss. In a February Medium post, Boylan alleged that he kissed her on the lips following a one-on-one briefing in his New York City office in 2018.Escalating backlash against Cuomo prompted him to release a statement at the time that acknowledged some of his comments in the workplace ""may have been insensitive or too personal"" and said he was ""truly sorry"" to those who might have ""misinterpreted (the remarks) as an unwanted flirtation.""Cuomo has denied ever touching anyone inappropriately.Beyond the investigation into the sexual harassment claims, James is also investigating nursing home deaths in New York and released a report in January that found that the state undercounted nursing home Covid-19-related deaths by about 50%.",New York Gov.

Cuomo's behavior was not limited to members of his own staff, but extended to other state employees, including a State Trooper on his protective detail, as well as members of the public, the attorney general's report states. Cuomo's conduct violated multiple federal and state laws, James said.""We also conclude that the Executive Chamber's culture -- one filled with fear and intimidation, while at the same time normalizing the Governor's frequent flirtations and gender-based comments -- contributed to the conditions that allowed the sexual harassment to occur and persist,"" investigators Joon Kim and Anne Clark wrote in the report.

She contemporaneously memorialized the governor's inappropriate touching in an email dated the day after the incident, according to the report.

Photographic evidence taken by one of Ruch's friends was provided to investigators, and after the incident Ruch told friends what had happened and how upset she was by Cuomo's actions, the report said. An unnamed executive assistant told investigators that Cuomo touched and grabbed her buttocks while they were hugging. The report said that Cuomo asked her ""multiple times about whether she had cheated or would cheat on her husband, and asking her to help find him a girlfriend.""

President Joe Biden said Cuomo should resign. New York legislators of both parties vehemently condemned Cuomo's conduct and are contemplating whether further action should be taken against the governor. Cuomo denies the allegations and has shown no willingness to resign over them.Here's what to know from the report and what to expect next:A pattern of inappropriate behavior and 'toxic' culture in the governor's officeThe investigators said they found a ""pattern"" of inappropriate behavior by Cuomo, which included both ""unwanted"" touching and comments of a ""suggestive and sexual nature."" All told, Cuomo harassed multiple women, both current and former staff members, and women outside of his office also reported harassment by the governor, the investigators said. The accounts of 11 women total were put forward in the report, some of them detailing allegations that never before had been made public. The investigators said their claims were corroborated by other people interviewed, as well as in contemporaneous evidence, like notes, emails and texts written soon after the alleged harassment occurred. The report detailed a ""toxic"" workplace environment under Cuomo and said that environment allowed for his allegedly harassing behavior to go overlooked. It also highlighted alleged instances of retaliation against at least one accuser.""We also conclude that the Executive Chamber's culture -- one filled with fear and intimidation, while at the same time normalizing the Governor's frequent flirtations and gender-based comments -- contributed to the conditions that allowed the sexual harassment to occur and persist,"" the report said. Numerous allegations of unwanted touchingSeveral women recounted to investigators unwanted touching by Cuomo, according to the report. One of them, a state trooper who served on Cuomo's protective detail, said on one occasion, Cuomo ran his finger down her neck and back while they were in an elevator. On another occasion, he ran his hand from her belly button to her right hip while she was holding the door for him, according to the report.  Another accuser, identified as ""Executive Assistant 1"" in the report, told investigators Cuomo grabbed her buttocks during hugs and a photo. The report also detailed an allegation, previously reported by the Albany Times Union, of an incident at the governor's mansion in which Cuomo allegedly, reached under her blouse and grabbed her breast. A separate accuser referred to in the report as a ""state entity employee,"" said Cuomo put his hand on, tapped and then grabbed her buttocks, while they were at a September 2019 event, according to the report. A woman named Anna Ruch said that Cuomo touched a part of her back exposed by a cutout in her dress, the report said. When she grabbed his wrist to move his hands, he responded, ""Wow, you're aggressive,"" according to the report. She was also photographed looking uncomfortable with Cuomo's hands on her face.Several of the accusers told the investigators that Cuomo made inappropriate remarks to them, including questions about their sexual histories, comments about their appearance and calling them nicknames like ""sweetheart"" or ""darling."" Cuomo fires back and shows no intentions of stepping down In a broadcast response released not long after the report was unveiled, Cuomo gave no indications he planned to resign. ""I want you to know directly from me that I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances,"" Cuomo said. He touted his cooperation in the attorney general's investigation, but he repeatedly suggested it was biased and tainted with politics. While he straight up denied some of the conduct -- such as the alleged groping incident in his governor's mansion office -- he claimed other aspects of his behavior described the report had been taken out of context. The governor's office interspersed within his statement photos of Cuomo hugging, kissing and embracing various individuals ""i do kiss people on the forehead, I do kiss people on the cheeks, I do kiss people on the hand,"" he said, while claiming that his ""everyday interactions"" with New Yorkers were being ""unfairly"" weaponized.

CNN,andrew cuomo sex scandal,6,Andrew Cuomo staffer files criminal complaint against the governor with the Albany sheriff's office,https://t.co/eo77UVfnxD?amp=1,"By Lauren del Valle and Veronica Stracqualursi, CNNUpdated 7:22 PM ET, Fri August 6, 2021  (CNN)New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's legal team on Friday attacked the state attorney general's report that found he sexually harassed 11 women, after one of those women, who is a staff member for Cuomo, recently filed a criminal complaint against the embattled Democrat with the Albany Sheriff's Office.CNN's Mark Morales and Sonia Moghe contributed to this report.New York Attorney General Letitia James' office has stood by its report released Tuesday, saying Cuomo's legal team denouncing the process behind it ""attacked the credibility of women."" Separately, Cuomo's attorneys have brushed off the first known criminal report from an accuser filed against him regarding allegations of sexual misconduct.The governor has denied in testimony that he inappropriately touched the accuser, while facing mounting legal and political pressure, including calls for his resignation or impeachment from office.During a more than hourlong virtual briefing Friday, Cuomo's legal team attacked the AG's report and the process by which it was released. Paul Fishman, an attorney representing the governor's office, said James' office declined to provide a copy of its report to Cuomo's office and to ""the people whose conduct would be discussed"" in it before it was publicly released. Cuomo's attorney Rita Glavin accused the report of being ""conducted in a manner to support a predetermined narrative."" Glavin continued: ""This was not an exercise in truth-finding.""When Glavin was asked by CNN how accusers -- including a state trooper on the governor's protective detail -- who are cited in attorney general's report would be shielded from potential retaliation, the attorney said, ""People are not going to be retaliated against by Governor Cuomo."" Glavin told CNN she would have to consult with her client -- the governor -- to confirm whether or not the state trooper is still on the governor's security detail.Glavin also said that Cuomo will address the misconduct allegation from the state trooper, but did not specify when.The attorney general's office responded to the Cuomo team's claims Friday, saying they ""attacked the credibility"" of the women who alleged sexual harassment against the governor, as well as the investigation into their claims, according to Fabien Levy, press secretary and senior adviser to James. ""The independent investigators selected are widely respected professionals, recognized for their legal and investigatory ability. To attack this investigation and attempt to undermine and politicize this process takes away from the bravery displayed by these women,"" Levy said.A ""rolling production"" of witness interview transcripts following appropriate redactions will be made available to the state assembly, he added.Debra Katz, the attorney representing Charlotte Bennett -- the second woman to go public with sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo -- said Friday that the governor ""has made clear he will continue his fight to stay in power, caring not at all about the people he has hurt and the consequences of his actions.""Katz also called on the New York state Assembly ""to act."" CNN has reported that the Assembly's impeachment investigation into various allegations of misconduct against Cuomo is close to concluding. As part of that process, Cuomo's team has said it will submit additional materials to the Assembly Judiciary Committee by the deadline of August 13.Criminal complaint The first known criminal report filed against the governor regarding allegations of sexual misconduct was confirmed to CNN by an attorney representing the anonymous accuser and a second source with direct knowledge. The Albany Sheriff's Office told CNN they've scheduled a press conference for noon Saturday, where it's expected they'll address the complaint.Albany County Undersheriff William Rice confirmed to CNN that a criminal complaint was filed by an unnamed accuser Thursday, but he did not go into details about the complaint. The governor's office had notified Albany Police of the allegation several months ago. Attorneys for Cuomo are not concerned about the criminal complaint, according to a source with direct knowledge. ""Not in the least,"" said the source when asked if the legal team was worried about the complaint. ""There's no evidence.""The anonymous accuser sat for an informal interview to discuss her allegations against the governor at the Albany Sheriff's Office Thursday, her attorney said.She was informed that the sheriff's office and Albany district attorney were obtaining all relevant information from the attorney general's investigators and will proceed from there, according to her attorney.

Andrew Cuomo's closest confidants spent the weekend trying to convince the Democrat to resign, sources tell CNN, an effort that comes amid fallout from a report that found he sexually harassed multiple women.CNN's Elizabeth Joseph, Lauren del Valle and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report. Cuomo, a source said, can't come to grips with the end of his time in office, telling his inner circle: ""I need more time.""Another source in close touch with the governor's close advisers said, ""no one in his inner circle of friends or staff"" believed, as of last week, that Cuomo would survive politically and must resign or face impeachment. Despite the consensus, ""he thinks he can wait it out,"" that source said.A report released last week by New York Attorney General Letitia James detailed the allegations of 11 women and found that Cuomo engaged in ""unwelcome and nonconsensual touching,"" among other allegations. The governor has insisted he did nothing wrong and made no indication in a video response following the report's release that he would step down. The comments from those near Cuomo's inner circle provide fresh insight into the governor's thinking nearly a week after the release of the damning report, which led to a barrage of calls for the governor's resignation from top state and national Democrats, including President Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and New York's two US senators. Cuomo is also facing a fast-moving impeachment effort by state lawmakers. CNN has reached out to Cuomo's office for comment.Asked about the pressure to resign, Rita Glavin, a personal attorney for Cuomo, told CNN's Erica Hill on ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" later Monday that right now ""the governor is very much focused on getting the evidence from the Assembly and being able to make a submission to the Assembly"" as part of its impeachment process.Still, Cuomo was in a ""fighting mood"" over the weekend even as many of his closest allies question the third-term governor's ability to survive the scandal and some prepare for when the governorship ultimately comes to an end, according to the Rev. Al Sharpton, who spoke with multiple people close to Cuomo over the weekend. ""People around him are looking for what's the next chapter in their life, I'll put it that way,"" Sharpton, a civil rights activist who has long been involved in New York politics, told CNN. ""Where do I get a job?""One of Cuomo's top aides, Melissa DeRosa, resigned late Sunday. The 38-year-old, who held the highest-ranking appointed position in the state, appeared throughout James' report.""I said to them -- I don't see how he survives,"" Sharpton added about his conversations with Cuomo advisers over the weekend.New York State Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs has also cast doubt on Cuomo's ability to remain in office amid the scandal, telling CNN on Monday that ""no one of sound mind"" would, at this point, be telling the governor ""that there's going to be anything other than a very bad outcome here"" if he does not resign.Jacobs, who called on Cuomo to leave office last week, also said that the governor is fully aware of how dire his prospects are -- especially if the state Assembly were to move forward with impeachment and the process advanced to the state Senate for a trial.""He doesn't have the votes in the Assembly, which will impeach him. He doesn't have the leadership of the Assembly, which will lead the impeachment. There's nobody holding that back,"" Jacobs said.He continued: ""They're all in favor of moving forward. And then you go to the Senate and forget about it. And he's made clear to me that he understands if he gets to the Senate, he's gone. He knows that.""Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat, told reporters on Monday that the impeachment investigation process into Cuomo could wrap within weeks, saying: ""You want to make sure things are right, but also done in an expeditious manner."" Since March, the Assembly's Judiciary Committee has been looking into Cuomo in four areas: the sexual harassment allegations, deaths in nursing homes from Covid-19, usurping state resources for personal gain and allegations of a cover-up over damaged bridge bolts on the Mario Cuomo Bridge, named after the former New York governor who is Andrew Cuomo's father.This story has been updated with comments from Gov.

CNN,andrew cuomo sex scandal,8,BREAKING: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says he's resigning in wake of state's investigation into sexual harassment allegations,https://t.co/kSn26oEhNc?amp=1,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that he will resign, relinquishing under extraordinary pressure his decade-long grip on power and heading off a potential impeachment by New York's Democratic-led legislature a week after the release of a report by the state attorney general that found he had sexually harassed 11 women.  """"Given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing,"""" Cuomo said in remarks from New York City. """"Therefore that's what I'll do."""" The son of another three-term governor, the New York Democrat indicated his announcement would take effect in two weeks. He will hand over the reins to his deputy of seven years, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Buffalo native who is now poised to become the state's first female governor. Democratic state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins would take on the active duties of the lieutenant governor should there be a vacancy in the position. Hochul will appoint her own replacement. In the seven days since New York state Attorney General Letitia James made her report public, Cuomo faced new and more adamant calls to step down from both state and national Democrats. He initially pushed back, seeking more time, against the advice of trusted aides but ultimately relented and decided to resign before state lawmakers could begin a process that would likely have made him the first New York governor to be impeached in more than a century.  The announcement capped a remarkable fall for the governor, who was lauded for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 only to see his administration swallowed up in scandal -- over his alleged sexual misbehavior, the underreporting of nursing home deaths related to the coronavirus and his potential abuse of public resources as he wrote a book last year about the pandemic in New York. As his handling of the pandemic came under increasing scrutiny, including through an ongoing federal inquiry, a series of reports about his personal behavior left him politically stricken. Even now, as he prepares to leave office, Cuomo could potentially face criminal charges related to the allegations against him. He is also being sued by one his accusers, former aide Lindsey Boylan. Cuomo has denied all of the allegations, saying he never touched anyone inappropriately, but acknowledged that some of his behavior made others uncomfortable. He continued to skirt the line between apology and excuses during his remarks on Tuesday, thanking the women who came forward with """"sincere"""" complaints, but -- as he did earlier this year -- he insisted that he was, politically, the victim of evolving social norms. """"In my mind, I've never crossed the line with anyone. But I didn't realize the extent to which the line has been redrawn,"""" Cuomo said. """"There are generational and cultural shifts that I just didn't fully appreciate. And I should have -- no excuses.""""","Cuomo: ""The best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing"" The New York Democrat says he",NOW we Need @GovRonDeSantis @GovAbbott to RESIGN too.,Yet Trump runs free,Negative Disgust,Negative Disgust,Cuomo resigns

The city’s gyms and fitness centers will expand to 50% capacity beginning May 15.",https://t.co/lJlp7Dua99?amp=1,"AdvertisementBy Linda QiuRestaurants in New York City can broaden indoor dining to 75 percent capacity beginning on May 7, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Friday, an expansion already available to restaurants in the rest of the state.The governor also said the city’s gyms and fitness centers would expand to 50 percent capacity beginning May 15. Hair salons, barber shops and other personal care services can move to to 75 percent capacity on May 7, he said. The expansions will effectively apply to the entire city because Mr. Cuomo also announced that he was rescinding his “micro-cluster zone strategy.” That set of restrictions were divided into three color-coded zones — red, orange and yellow — each with different rules for gatherings, schools and businesses for specific neighborhoods or boroughs, in New York City. Zones in the rest of the state had been lifted earlier this year. The governor’s announcement came a day after Mayor Bill de Blasio declared that New York City would fully reopen on July 1, after more than a year of virus-related restrictions imposed by the governor.After months of persistently high case numbers during a second virus wave, the city has started to turn a corner, particularly as the weather has warmed and drawn residents outside. Public health officials and epidemiologists expect vaccinations to continue to drive down new cases over the next two months.Still, they have acknowledged that the virus will likely remain a threat, at least to some extent.At a White House news conference on Friday, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the mayor’s July 1 date “a reasonable target” if the current pace of vaccinations and declines in case numbers continued. She declined to predict updates to the C.D.C.’s guidance that those dining indoors should wear masks except when actively eating or drinking, noting that “this virus has tricked us before.” At a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Cuomo scoffed at Mr. de Blasio’s comment about the city reopening by July 1, emphasizing that the state was in charge. He said that he was “reluctant to make projections” on a reopening date, saying that doing so would be “irresponsible.”Even so, the governor, who has moved recently to roll back restrictions, said that he too was hopeful that a wider reopening was within sight, possibly sooner than Mr. de Blasio’s goal. “I think that if we do what we have to do, we can be reopened earlier,” Mr. Cuomo said.Earlier this week, the governor said that the longstanding curfew requiring establishments to stop serving customers at midnight will end statewide on May 17 for outdoor dining areas and May 31 for indoor dining.Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, said in a statement on Friday that easing restrictions on restaurants and bars “provides a shot of optimism to small business owners and workers who have been financially devastated over the past year.”“We look forward to working with Governor Cuomo’s administration to safely reopen New York City, so we can get the restaurant capital of the world cooking again,” he said. Michael Gold contributed reporting.Advertisement",Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that New York City will fully reopen indoor dining to the entire public on May 7.

NYT,andrew cuomo sex scandal,2,"Four women who have accused Governor Andrew Cuomo of sexual harassment have received subpoenas to testify under oath, the latest indication that the state attorney general’s investigation into his behavior has entered a critical phase.",https://t.co/Mo2k9kfYO4?amp=1,"ALBANY, N.Y. — Four women who have accused Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of sexual harassment have received subpoenas to testify under oath, the latest indication that the state attorney general’s investigation into Mr. Cuomo’s behavior has entered a critical phase.  The issuing of the subpoenas, which was expected at some point in the inquiry, underscores the investigation’s progress beyond an initial fact-finding phase, during which lawyers interviewed multiple women at length, but not under oath.  The attorney general, Letitia James, has not set a deadline for releasing the findings of her office’s inquiry, which began in early March, but it will almost certainly be completed by summer’s end, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation who was not authorized to discuss it publicly.  In the past few months, outside lawyers hired by Ms. James have requested troves of state records and have held hourslong preliminary interviews with several of the women now being asked to testify under oath. Joon H. Kim, a former federal prosecutor, and Anne L. Clark, a prominent employment lawyer, who are overseeing the inquiry, have led the interviews.   Ms. Clark has been delving into the specifics of the sexual harassment accusations. She has collected vast documentation of the claims, including text messages, emails and photographs that Mr. Cuomo’s accusers say support their allegations, according to two people who were present at interviews with the women and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.  Mr. Kim, the two people said, is examining closely whether Mr. Cuomo or his aides broke any laws, destroyed documents or other evidence or sought to retaliate against the governor’s accusers or interfere with the investigation in any way. The investigators are also looking into whether Mr. Cuomo and members of his staff followed the appropriate processes for dealing with sexual harassment, the two people said.  The lawyers have cast a wide net, issuing subpoenas to executive chamber staff members that seek emails, documents and other materials that, in some cases, date as far back as 2013, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Charlotte Bennett, a former aide to the governor who says Mr. Cuomo, 63, made sexual advances when they were alone in his Albany office, is expected to provide testimony under oath in the next two weeks, her lawyer, Debra Katz, said.  Ms. Bennett, whose allegations against Mr. Cuomo were the impetus for the attorney general’s inquiry, sat with investigators for more than four hours of preliminary interviews in March, Ms. Katz said. Ms. Bennett, 25, has also provided more than “120 pages of contemporaneous records” and has identified more than two dozen possible eyewitnesses, Ms. Katz said.",Four women who have accused Gov.

Andrew M. Cuomo, was published in October.  “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons From the Covid-19 Pandemic,” a memoir by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, was published in October. Credit...Pool photo by Mary Altaffer By J. David Goodman, Alexandra Alter, Rachel Abrams and Luis Ferré-Sadurní Published May 17, 2021 Updated Oct. 5, 2021 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was expected to earn more than $5 million from his book about leading New York during the coronavirus pandemic, according to figures released by his office on Monday, as investigators continued to look into his use of state resources to write and promote the book.  The governor received the bulk of the money last year, $3.12 million, and under the contract, he is set to be paid another $2 million in installments over the next two years, state officials said.  The windfall book deal, which dwarfed the governor’s salary of $225,000, was reached last year after Mr. Cuomo rose to national prominence for televised news briefings during the pandemic’s uncertain early phase, when New York was the nation’s epicenter.  But the disclosure of the details on Monday arrived as Mr. Cuomo and his administration found themselves in a very different place: mired in multiple overlapping investigations into accusations of sexual harassment by the governor, his handling of nursing home death data and his use of government resources for work on the book.  ADVERTISEMENT  Continue reading the main story  Across the publishing world, the revelation of Mr. Cuomo’s payment elicited shock: The amount appeared to be a staggering sum to pay to a politician who already had a meager sales record for his previous book, a memoir that sold just a few thousand print copies.  While former presidents have garnered multimillion-dollar advances — Bill Clinton sold his autobiography to Knopf for about $15 million, while Barack and Michelle Obama received some $65 million from Penguin Random House for their books — Mr. Cuomo’s book deal appeared far larger than those for other well-known elected officials.  Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who ran for president in 2020, has written three books in recent years, receiving total advance payments worth nearly $3.5 million since 2013. That includes a $250,000 payment last year for her recently released book. Senator Ted Cruz reported a book deal in 2020 on his financial disclosure that included an advance of $400,000, to be paid in three installments, along with other terms.  Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, said that Mr. Cuomo had netted about $1.5 million from the book last year, after expenses and taxes.  The governor donated a third of that — $500,000 — to the United Way of New York State for its statewide Covid relief and vaccination efforts and placed the remainder in a trust for his three daughters, Mr. Azzopardi said in a statement.  The governor had been required to file a financial disclosure with a state commission by Monday, but his release of tax records and the detailed accounting of his payments related to the book went beyond the state’s requirements. Mr. Cuomo has routinely allowed reporters to review his tax records each year.  Hours before the release of the figures, Mr. Cuomo made a series of major pandemic-related announcements, including the end of most mask mandates in the state for vaccinated New Yorkers, the loosening of capacity restrictions on businesses, and the return of the New York City Marathon and the Tribeca Film Festival.  In total, with money from the book as well as salary and investments, the governor reported nearly $3.7 million in total income last year, according to his tax records.  The book, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons From the Covid-19 Pandemic,” proved a lucrative endeavor for the governor, but since its publication in October, it has become a minefield for him and his publisher, Crown.  The publisher canceled promotion and any plans for a paperback version in March, after The New York Times reported that Mr. Cuomo’s most senior aides had rewritten a state Health Department report on nursing home fatalities to hide the number of actual deaths, just as Mr. Cuomo was starting to write his book. The handling of that data is currently the subject of a federal investigation.  The governor’s office has denied changing or altering the data on nursing home deaths.  After The Times reported that aides to the governor had assisted in the writing and promotion of the book, the state attorney general, Letitia James, opened an investigation into Mr. Cuomo’s use of state resources on the project. The Times reported at the time that the deal had been worth at least $4 million.

The 165-page report said that Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, and his aides cultivated a toxic work culture in his office that was rife with fear and intimidation, and helped enable “harassment to occur and created a hostile work environment.”  The report included at least two previously unreported allegations of sexual harassment from women who accused Mr. Cuomo of improperly touching them, including an unnamed female state trooper and an employee of an energy company. And it highlighted at least one instance in which Mr. Cuomo and his aides retaliated against a woman who made her allegations public.  “Governor Cuomo sexually harassed current and former state employees in violation of both federal and state laws,” Ms. James said. “The independent investigation found that Governor Cuomo harassed multiple women, many of whom were young women, by engaging in unwanted groping, kisses, hugging, and by making inappropriate comments.”  After the release of the report, a growing number of Democratic lawmakers called on Mr. Cuomo to resign from office. President Biden bluntly said “yes” when asked if he thought the governor should step down.  The Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, Carl E.

""I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances,"" he said.",https://t.co/y4TLBNCva3?amp=1,"President Biden called on Tuesday for the resignation of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York after the state’s attorney general found that Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, had sexually harassed multiple women.  Asked at the White House if Mr. Cuomo should leave office, Mr. Biden responded bluntly: “Yes.” He stopped short of calling for Mr. Cuomo to be removed if he refuses to resign. “Let’s take one thing at a time,” Mr. Biden said.  Mr. Biden, a longtime friend of Mr. Cuomo’s, had avoided addressing the accusations when they arose earlier this year, appearing content to stay on the sidelines of a growing rift between the Democratic Party and the increasingly isolated New York governor.  In March, when asked about the accusations against Mr. Cuomo, the president told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News that the governor should resign if the investigation turned back evidence of harassment.  “Yes,” Mr. Biden said at the time. “I think he’ll probably end up being prosecuted, too.”  Mr. Biden did not say Tuesday if he supported the idea that Mr. Cuomo should be prosecuted, and he did not answer when asked what message he had for Mr. Cuomo’s accusers.  “What I said was if the investigation by the attorney general concluded that the allegations were correct, back in March, I would recommend he resign,” Mr. Biden said. “That is what I’m doing today.”  The president said that he had not spoken to Mr. Cuomo and that he had not read the full report on the harassment accusations, issued on Tuesday by the New York State attorney general, Letitia James.  “All I know is the end result,” Mr. Biden said.    Mr. Cuomo, who is facing a criminal investigation by the Albany County prosecutor, has vowed to stay in office, calling the report biased and saying the “facts are much different from what has been portrayed.” But on Tuesday, the last of his high-profile Democratic allies began distancing themselves.  “As always, I commend the women who came forward to speak their truth,” Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, said in a statement. “Recognizing his love of New York and the respect for the office he holds, I call upon the governor to resign.”  Ms. Pelosi’s condemnation was all the more striking given the close personal relationship she has shared with the Cuomo family, fellow Italian American Democrats, going back more than 40 years. At the invitation of President Jimmy Carter, Ms. Pelosi and Mario Cuomo traveled from village to devastated village in Italy in 1980 to offer a show of American support after a major earthquake left more than 2,000 people dead.  Four years later, Mr. Cuomo delivered his famous Tale of Two Cities speech at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, Ms. Pelosi’s adopted hometown; she served as chairwoman of the host committee. She has remained close to the current governor, as well, and held back when other Democratic leaders rushed to call for his ouster this spring.  After her statement on Tuesday, that only left Mr. Biden, who initially had emphasized the importance of an independent investigation to verify the claims. The two formed a friendship as Mr. Biden was mulling running for president in 2015. The president wrote in his memoir that Mr. Cuomo was one of the few Democrats who did not dissuade him from exploring a campaign: “You’ll live with it the rest of your life,” Mr. Biden recalled Mr. Cuomo saying.  Mr. Biden has since thought of Mr. Cuomo warmly, and eventually the friendship grew into a vital political alliance, particularly as both men have worked to beat back the spread of the pandemic.  On Tuesday, Mr. Biden appeared to offer a gesture of support for the governor when asked if he approved of Mr. Cuomo using photos of the two men embracing to suggest that his physical contact with others was commonplace.  “I am sure there are some embraces that were totally innocent,” Mr. Biden said. “Apparently the attorney general decided there were things that were not.”  Earlier in the day, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, was asked to expand on Mr. Biden’s feelings about the harassment. She would only offer her own.  “All women who have lived through this type of experience,” Ms. Psaki said, “harassment or abuse or, in the worst case, assault, deserve to have their voices heard. I don’t know that anyone could’ve watched this morning and not found the allegations to be abhorrent.”",President Biden said he would recommend the resignation of Cuomo if he refuses to resign.

In a statement, Mr. Jacobs said that the governor’s removal from office was “inevitable,” and that Mr. Cuomo’s refusal to step down ran counter to Mr. Jacobs’s advice.  “The governor has lost his ability to govern, both practically and morally,” said Mr. Jacobs, who was handpicked by Mr. Cuomo for the job in 2019.",Four more prosecutors say they will investigate the governor's behavior.

WSJ,andrew cuomo sex scandal,1,New York attorney general to investigate Cuomo following sexual harassment complaints by two former staffers,https://t.co/7GOJjORoSY?amp=1,"NEW YORK — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) formally referred allegations of sexual harassment against him to the state's attorney general on Monday, a move that initiates an investigation of the veteran politician after two former aides alleged misconduct.The required referral letter was sent to the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), who will name outside investigators to head the probe of Cuomo’s alleged misdeeds involving two women who worked in his administration. The letter, signed by Beth Garvey, special counsel and senior adviser to the governor, was disseminated in a news release later in the day.“All New York State employees have been directed to fully cooperate with this review,” Garvey wrote, adding that she would be the point of contact for interviews and documents from the executive chamber and other relevant offices.James, in a statement released Monday, said her office would release a public report at the conclusion of the investigation, which will begin after the outside attorneys or law firm is retained.“This is not a responsibility we take lightly as allegations of sexual harassment should always be taken seriously,” James said in a statement with the letter’s release.Cuomo reverses course on sexual harassment investigation, offers apologyInitially, Cuomo resisted sending the review to James’s office, instead suggesting former federal judge Barbara Jones be selected to take up the issue and pivoting later to propose the state’s highest-ranking judge, Janet DiFiore, run the inquiry. Those efforts were quickly overcome by demands from Cuomo’s fellow Democrats for an independent probe.Former Cuomo aide Charlotte Bennett detailed her alleged experience with Cuomo in a New York Times article on Saturday, saying the third-term governor harassed her last spring during the peak of the state’s coronavirus response. The 25-year-old told the Times that Cuomo, 63, delved into her personal life in inappropriate ways and sought her opinion on romantic relationships with older men.Another accuser, Lindsey Boylan, said last week in an essay published on Medium that Cuomo made inappropriate gestures and comments, including on a flight back from an event across the state in 2017, sought to engineer meetings with her alone and once kissed her on the mouth at his office in New York City.Both women said they were uncomfortable and feared repercussions for brushing him off.A third woman, Anna Ruch, on Monday described to the New York Times an unwelcome encounter with Cuomo at a 2019 wedding in Manhattan.In an Instagram story reviewed by The Washington Post, Ruch superimposed a statement over a screenshot of a Times story about Bennett’s account.“Slid his hand on my lower back which I promptly removed and then he proceeded to grab my face with both hands and asked if he could kiss me, laid one on my cheek and then told me I was aggressive,” she wrote.She later posted an image of the encounter, which showed Cuomo with his hands on both sides of her face. Ruch could not immediately be reached for comment.In a statement Sunday, Cuomo said he “never intended to offend anyone or cause any harm” and described his actions as the result of his “playful” nature.“I do, on occasion, tease people in what I think is a good-natured way,” the statement read. “ … I have teased people about their personal lives, their relationships, about getting married or not getting married. I mean no offense and only attempt to add some levity and banter to what is a very serious business.”He added that he “never inappropriately touched anybody and I never propositioned anybody.”Bennett said in a statement Monday that Cuomo’s comments amounted to a refusal “to acknowledge or take responsibility for his predatory behavior.”She said the fact that Cuomo agreed to an independent investigation only after “significant backlash” shows he’s a person “who wields his power to avoid justice.”Calls mount for independent investigation into Cuomo’s sexual harassment allegationsIn a separate statement, Bennett’s attorney, Debra S. Katz, called Cuomo’s behavior “textbook sexual harassment” and said his own comments about his exchanges with employees are evidence that “the problem is a systemic one and the Attorney General must investigate whether other women were subjected to a sexually hostile work environment.”“We are confident that no disinterested investigator who reviews this evidence would adopt the Governor’s self-serving characterization of his behavior as mentorship or, at worst, unwanted flirtation,” Katz added.The Washington-based civil rights attorney also called on James’s office to identify anyone in Cuomo’s administration who enabled his behavior.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has a long-running feud with Cuomo, said in a news briefing Monday that Cuomo’s words were “not an apology.” He pointed to Cuomo’s suggestion that his jokes with staff may have been misinterpreted, noting “sexual harassment is not funny.”Cuomo “just clea",New York's attorney general formally refers allegations of sexual harassment against him to the state's attorney general.

WSJ,andrew cuomo sex scandal,2,"Andrew Cuomo and the old ""I was just being playful"" excuse",https://t.co/npTclPh574?amp=1,"Re: Andrew Cuomo. The New York governor has now been accused of unwanted sexual attention by three women. His second accuser, who went public with her story over the weekend, says that her former boss’s harassment took place within the past year, i.e. when Cuomo had never been more visible or famous: He was giving nationally televised news conferences and basking in his role as America’s designated pandemic dad.If Charlotte Bennett’s allegations are true — she provided the New York Times with contemporaneous text messages in which she told a friend about the governor expressing interest in her sex life — then we can presume one of two things:Option 1: Andrew Cuomo was just kidding around.His current defense pleads this option. In a statement released Sunday, he said that “at work sometimes, I think I am being playful and I make jokes I think are funny,” in an attempt to “add some levity and banter to what is a very serious business,” and that he had now come to understand that his interactions “may have been insensitive or too personal.”He did not address specific accusations, although he did say he never “touched” or “propositioned” anyone (his first accuser, Lindsey Boylan, had said that he kissed her without consent). Cuomo told the New York Times that he considered his relationship with Bennett, the second accuser, as being that of a mentor.Letitia James, the state attorney general, has now been given full purview to investigate the claims. This is the right development, and a chance to answer some clarifying questions:Did Cuomo ask his male mentees whether they were monogamous in relationships, and whether they’d ever had sex with an older man?Did Cuomo ever tell his male mentees that he was thinking about the last time he’d hugged someone, and then, if they awkwardly said they missed hugging their parents, replied, “No, I mean like really hugged somebody.”Did Cuomo, 63, ever acknowledge his male mentees’ 25th birthdays, and then casually note that he was fine with dating “anyone above the age of 22”?Bennett says Cuomo made all of these remarks to her. If that’s true, does that create a blatantly hostile work environment? Would these actions place Cuomo in the pantheon of hideous boss-men such as Harvey Weinstein and Charlie Rose?Timeline: Andrew Cuomo’s comments about sexual misconduct vs. the allegations against himThese questions bring us to Option 2:Andrew Cuomo knew exactly what he was doing. But he was crafty about it. He was operating in a world of plausible deniability and limited liability. He was saying things that were uncomfortable, but not criminal.If Lindsey Boylan had responded flirtatiously to Cuomo allegedly calling her alone into his office to show off the cigar box Bill Clinton had given him — which she says happened and which she thought was an allusion to Clinton infamously using a cigar as a sex toy with Monica Lewinsky — then, great! Cuomo could feel free to act on the “crush” that colleagues told Boylan the governor was nursing.But if she responded negatively, if she complained or said it was inappropriate? Well, lady, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.Under this dynamic, Boylan and Bennett could be his paramours, or they could be crazy. Either way, Cuomo would get to retain the image of an appropriate boss and a stand-up man in the eyes of the public — and perhaps in his own eyes, too.What it became increasingly difficult for both women to do, they say, was just be his employees.So, which option was it? Nobody but Cuomo can know for sure. But Option 2 is the most plausible to me, and maybe to anyone who has ever heard a variation of, “Wouldn’t it be funny if you cheated on your boyfriend with me hahaha just kidding.”The writer Lili Loofbourow coined the phrase “male bumbler epidemic” to describe all the accused men whose defense was, essentially, that they were far too incompetent to have harassed anyone.“The world baffles the bumbler,” Loofbourow wrote. “He’s astonished to discover that he had power over anyone at all, let alone that he was perceived as using it. . . . The bumbler takes one of our culture’s most muscular myths — that men are clueless — and weaponizes it into an alibi.”And so we get:“At work sometimes, I think I am being playful and I make jokes I think are funny.”“I now understand that my interactions may have been insensitive or too personal.”Only now, Governor? Several years into the #MeToo movement? After dozens of powerful men have faced consequences for their inappropriate workplace behavior? A politician with the social acumen to rise to one of the more powerful positions in the country only now realizes that 20-something women don’t like being queried about their sex lives by their 60-something bosses while at work?(His third accuser, Anna Ruch, says she met Cuomo in 2019 at a friend’s wedding, where he placed his hand on her bare lower back and, after she removed it, cupped her cheeks in his hands and asked, out of the blue, if he could kiss her: A pho",Andrew Cuomo has been accused of inappropriate sexual attention by three women.

WSJ,andrew cuomo sex scandal,3,N.Y. Gov. Andrew Cuomo says he will not resign over sexual harassment allegations but apologizes ‘for whatever pain I caused’,https://t.co/iCFNSnfyW4?amp=1,"New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Wednesday that he would not resign in the face of a growing sexual harassment scandal, instead asking New Yorkers to wait for a full investigation of his behavior. He also offered a more expansive apology to the women who he acknowledged he had hurt.“I have learned from what has been an incredibly difficult situation for me as well as other people,” he said, appearing to become emotional as he spoke. “I have learned an important lesson. I am sorry. I am sorry for whatever pain I have caused anyone. I never intended it.”Cuomo (D), 63, maintained that he had never touched any woman “inappropriately” but admitted that his behavior had caused harm in ways he said he did not recognize at the time.“It was unintentional, and I truly and deeply apologize for it,” he said. “I feel awful about it, and frankly I am embarrassed by it, and that is not easy to say. But that is the truth.”He said he would not step back from his official duties, despite his mistakes.“I’m not going to resign,” he said. “I work for the people of the state of New York. They elected me.”The three-term governor had faced increasing pressure for more than a week, after two women he worked with alleged he had sexually harassed them, accounts that were at least partially backed up by contemporaneous records.Advisers have said they believe he can weather the scandal if no more women come forward and the independent investigation by Attorney General Letitia James (D) fails to show anything more damning than what has been alleged so far.Cuomo decided to appear publicly Wednesday, after a day when no new women came forward, according to a person close to him, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions. The governor still has not spoken to his entire staff about the allegations.His comments at Wednesday’s news conference were promptly rejected by Cuomo’s critics, who argued that he still had not come clean on what he knew about the discomfort he had been causing women who worked for him.“The Governor repeatedly said he had no idea he made anyone uncomfortable,” attorney Debra Katz said in a statement. “My client, Charlotte Bennett, reported his sexually harassing behavior immediately to his Chief of Staff and Chief Counsel. We are confident that they made him aware of her complaint.”Another of his accusers, Lindsey Boylan, tweeted an quick condemnation of the governor’s new defense, as well.“How can New Yorkers trust you @NYGovCuomo to lead our state if you ‘don’t know’ when you’ve been inappropriate with your own staff?” she wrote.The accusations by the women have eroded Cuomo’s political standing, leading prominent members of his own party, such as President Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) to call for an investigation into his behavior. Some New York legislators and one House member from the state’s Democratic delegation have demanded his resignation.Cuomo’s office has asked prominent state Democratic lawmakers not to blindside them with calls for resignation, a person familiar with the request said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. But Cuomo is not exerting the kind of brute political force he has in the past to wield power over lawmakers, this person said.Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, an influential group of New York CEOs, said the business community is not jumping to judgment on the issue and will await the review from the attorney general.“Business considers Cuomo their only ally most of the time when it comes to critical tax and economic issues, and his vulnerability right now is shaking the confidence of the private sector generally in the recovery of the city,” Wylde said.The Rev. Al Sharpton, the New York activist and community leader, said he does not want to “prejudge” the investigation and said whether Cuomo would have to resign or not run for reelection depends on what evidence emerges.“The general attitude I’m getting among my constituency is people want to wait and see the evidence of what comes out,” Sharpton said. He praised Cuomo for taking on racial inequities in the pandemic, passing the Eric Garner law on policing and “reaching out to the Black community more than most other politicians.”“His standing in the Black community before this has been probably good. His standing is probably better than most. The only one with higher standing, or as high, is the attorney general,” Sharpton said.Sharpton said the governor had made a mistake by not holding the news conference sooner. “What he should be doing is what he did today, but he should have done it two days ago. My takeaway is that he handled it pretty well today, but he gave them room in not holding a news conference, it looked like he was running for the press.”Sharpton said he had known Cuomo for 35 years, and “we’ve had good days and bad days . . . we’re not buddy, buddy.

WSJ,andrew cuomo sex scandal,4,"Cuomo’s behavior created ""hostile, toxic"" workplace culture for decades, former aides say",https://t.co/GU0ahgIEan?amp=1,"A former press aide of Andrew M. Cuomo says he summoned her to his dimly lit hotel room and embraced her after  a work event in 2000, when Cuomo led the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and she was a consultant for the agency. The woman, Karen Hinton, says she pulled away from Cuomo, but he pulled her back toward his body, holding her before she backed away and left the room.Two male aides who worked for Cuomo in the New York governor’s office say he routinely berated them with explicit language, making comments such as calling them “pussies” and saying, “You have no balls.”And three women, all of whom worked in the governor’s office  as young staffers in recent years, say Cuomo quizzed them about their dating lives. They say they did not view the encounters as propositions, but rather as part of an office culture they believed was degrading to young women.The newest accounts of Cuomo’s workplace behavior by former aides in interviews with The Washington Post come after several women have publicly accused the New York governor of inappropriate personal comments or unwelcome physical contact. The allegations have engulfed one of the country’s top Democratic officials in crisis and put a sharp focus on the workplace culture he has fostered during his three decades in public office.What Cuomo has touted as an “aggressive” style goes far beyond that behind the scenes, according to more than 20 people who have worked with him from the 1990s to the present. Many former aides and advisers described to The Post a toxic culture in which the governor unleashes searing verbal attacks on subordinates. Some said he seemed to delight in humiliating his employees, particularly in group meetings, and would mock male aides for not being tough enough.The Post reached out to more than 150 former and current Cuomo staffers, stretching back to his time at HUD in Washington. Most did not respond. Among those who did, the majority spoke on the condition of anonymity, because they said they still fear his wrath and his power to destroy careers.In a statement, Peter Ajemian, Cuomo’s director of communications, vehemently denied Hinton’s account of her encounter with Cuomo in a hotel room.“This did not happen,” he said. “Karen Hinton is a known antagonist of the Governor’s who is attempting to take advantage of this moment to score cheap points with made up allegations from 21 years ago. All women have the right to come forward and tell their story — however, it’s also the responsibility of the press to consider self-motivation. This is reckless.”Rich Azzopardi, a senior Cuomo adviser, said in a separate statement that in his eight years in the governor’s office, he “never heard him use coarse language” as attributed to him by former male aides.Ajemian said the governor “works day and night” for the people of New York.“There is no secret these are tough jobs, and the work is demanding, but we have a top tier team with many employees who have been here for years, and many others who have left and returned,” he said in his statement. “The Governor is direct with employees if their work is sub-par because the people of New York deserve nothing short of excellence. ‎”In a news conference Wednesday, Cuomo denied touching women “inappropriately” but apologized if his interactions with women caused offense or pain. He pleaded for the public to wait for the results of a state attorney general-led probe into the claims by two former staffers who said he sexually harassed them.“I never knew at the time that I was making anyone feel uncomfortable,” he said. “I never, ever meant to offend anyone or hurt anyone or cause anyone pain.”Former aides said they were infuriated by Cuomo’s attempt to minimize what they described as a pervasive effort to intimidate staff.In response to the denial of her account, Hinton said “attacking the accuser is the classic playbook of powerful men trying to protect themselves.” She said watching the news conference “drove me crazy” and Cuomo knew better, saying he was regularly flirtatious with women, what she viewed as part of a broader effort to manipulate those around him. “I really thought the flirt wasn’t about having sex,” she said. “It was about controlling the relationship.”Added one woman who worked in his Albany office when she was in her 20s: “What this is is a systemic, intentional, hostile, toxic workplace environment that . . . perpetuates abusive treatment of people who don’t have power or resources.”Andrew M. Cuomo, once touted as the ‘gold standard,’ finds his brand tarnished by multiple crisesLongtime staffers described what they said is a Jekyll-and-Hyde aspect to Cuomo: charming one moment, raging with anger the next.

WSJ,andrew cuomo sex scandal,5,"N.Y. State Assembly authorizes inquiry of sex harassment allegations against Gov. Cuomo, a potential first step toward impeachment",https://t.co/No8FriOaLZ?amp=1,"The New York State Assembly on Thursday authorized an investigation of sexual harassment allegations against New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a potential first step toward impeachment.The decision to authorize a probe by the Judiciary Committee came after more than three dozen Democrats in the lower house called on Cuomo (D) to resign.“The reports of accusations concerning the governor are serious,” Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie said in a statement authorizing the investigation. “The committee will have the authority to interview witnesses, subpoena documents and evaluate evidence, as is allowed by the New York State Constitution.”The decision, after a hastily called meeting among Assembly Democrats, marked a rapid shift of fortunes for the governor, who had been struggling to hold back calls for him to leave office as the number of women accusing him of improper conduct has grown.The announcement followed an admission by Cuomo’s acting counsel, Beth Garvey, that she had referred to Albany police a recent complaint about Cuomo’s behavior. The Albany Times Union reported Wednesday that a woman, who has not been named, said the governor put his hand under her blouse and fondled her last year. The Washington Post has not independently confirmed the account.“As a matter of state policy when allegations of physical contact are made, the agency informs the complainant that they should contact their local police department,” Garvey said. “If they decline, the agency has an obligation to reach out themselves and inform the department of the allegation.”Cuomo has been accused of improper touching, inappropriate workplace conversations or both by six women in recent weeks, including five who worked for him. He has denied any inappropriate touching and apologized for conversations that he says he did not know at the time were harmful. Before the Assembly Democrats’ action, state Attorney General Letitia James had launched an investigation.“I have never done anything like this,” Cuomo said in a statement after the Times Union reported the alleged groping incident. “The details of this report are gut-wrenching. I am not going to speak to the specifics of this or any other allegation given the ongoing review, but I am confident in the result of the Attorney General’s report.”The latest accusation appeared to have had an impact on sentiment among members of the legislature. Forty Democratic members of the Assembly and 19 Democratic state senators — a substantial minority of legislative party members — released a statement Thursday morning calling on Cuomo to step down because of the allegations and a separate investigation into the handling of ­covid-19 nursing home death data.The lawmakers said Cuomo had “lost the confidence of the public and the state legislature, rendering him ineffective in this time of most urgent need.”If the Assembly Democrats voted with the Assembly’s 43 Republicans for impeachment, Cuomo would be referred for a trial in the state Senate, where the Democratic majority leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, has also called for Cuomo to resign.The separate attorney general’s investigation, also undertaken with subpoena power, is being conducted by lawyers appointed by James and is expected to continue.“Today’s action by the New York state legislature will have no bearing on our independent investigation into these allegations against Governor Cuomo,” James said late Thursday in a statement. “Our investigation will continue.” Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy",The New York State Assembly authorized an investigation of sexual harassment allegations against New York Gov.

WSJ,andrew cuomo sex scandal,6,Cuomo rejects calls to resign from multiple Democrats in N.Y. congressional delegation,https://t.co/FbRAYUksMH?amp=1,"An increasingly isolated Andrew M. Cuomo defiantly refused to resign as New York’s governor Friday after a majority of his state’s congressional delegation joined calls from most state legislators for him to step down amid a growing sexual harassment scandal.Cuomo (D) instead attacked the lawmakers, who by the evening included the state’s two U.S. senators, Charles E. Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, as being “reckless and dangerous” for using news reports and the public testimonials of women as a basis for pushing him from office before an independent investigation concludes.“The people of New York should not have confidence in a politician who takes a position without knowing any facts or substance,” he said. “Do I think it is responsible to take a position on a serious allegation before you have any facts? No, I don’t think it is responsible.”Cuomo, 63, has held on to office by arguing that a full investigation of the claims against him will vindicate his behavior, even as he has been evasive about some of the particulars of what may have happened with the women. He avoided a direct question Friday about whether he had what he understood to be a consensual relationship with any of his accusers, saying only that he had “not had a sexual relationship that was inappropriate, period.”Several Cuomo advisers said Friday that he was planning to rely on his support among Black voters, particularly in New York City, and to dispute or downplay every charge until he is vindicated by the investigation now beginning under the state’s attorney general, Letitia James (D), or until he is removed from office.“People know the difference between playing politics, bowing to cancel culture and the truth,” Cuomo said Friday. “Let the review proceed. I’m not going to resign.”It took only a matter of hours Friday for Cuomo to lose the support of most of his congressional delegation, as well as Schumer and Gillibrand, who had previously said they were withholding judgment until James’s investigation was completed.“Due to the multiple, credible sexual harassment and misconduct allegations, it is clear that Governor Cuomo has lost the confidence of his governing partners and the people of New York,” Schumer, the Senate majority leader, and Gillibrand said in a joint statement. “Governor Cuomo should resign.”The rapid shift ended weeks of hesitation by Democratic leaders, who had held out hope that a full investigation of Cuomo’s actions could be completed before a verdict was passed on his term in office.The initial delay by Democratic leaders represented a marked departure from the quick demands that previously greeted high-profile men accused of wrongdoing. Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was fired from his company three days after actresses accused him of sexual misconduct in 2017. Weeks later, the head of Amazon Studios, Roy Price, resigned days after a producer accused him of propositioning her.In Washington, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sought the resignation of Rep. Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.) later that year, a day after he was accused of propositioning and touching the leg of a fundraiser for his campaign. (He did not resign, but he did not seek reelection.)Second thoughts among some Democrats about the 2018 resignation of Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), and subsequent allegations, including claims made about Biden’s behavior and accusations against Brett M. Kavanaugh, now a Supreme Court justice, have prompted an evolution in thinking about how to confront such incidents.Amid more sexual harassment accusations against Cuomo last week, nearly two dozen women elected to the state legislature drafted a joint statement of concern — not because of the allegations but because they worried about growing calls for his immediate resignation without a full investigation.“As an African American woman, tons of my people have been incarcerated without having due process. There should be due process,” said State Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes (D), who organized the statement independent of the governor’s aggressive damage-control efforts.The worry, she said, was not just that Cuomo could be railroaded. It was also for his accusers. “They deserve more than just a newspaper article,” she said. “They deserve to be heard.”The call for an investigation to be completed first has faced increasing pushback as the number of accusers against Cuomo has grown. New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams (D) said he expected Black support for Cuomo to begin to fade, comparing the governor’s defiance to that of former president Donald Trump.“Black voters are not a monolith, but they have been supportive of the governor over the years,” he said. “But I think that’s starting to erode.”Cuomo has been accused of workplace harassment, improper touching or both by five women, including four who worked for him.

WSJ,andrew cuomo sex scandal,7,"Through Zoom press conferences, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's staff can mute reporters from whom they don’t want to hear",https://t.co/3Ug7Uo9MPX?amp=1,"A media lesson from the scandal-plagued office of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo: It’s much easier to mute your critics if you can array them behind a mute function.Jesse McKinley knows the feeling. As Albany bureau chief for the New York Times, McKinley wrote last June about his participation in the world-famous in-person press briefings that Cuomo conducted in the state Capitol’s Red Room. Those sessions brought new fame and credibility to the governor, positioning him as a sane counterweight to disinfectant-obsessed then-President Donald Trump. “The only day in Albany I didn’t get a question in happened to come a day after I wrote a critical story about his casting of blame on others,” wrote McKinley.But as the governor’s fortunes have sunk in recent months, so have McKinley’s opportunities to put questions before the governor in news conferences. The last time was Jan. 22, says McKinley.The governor’s season of scandal kicked off on Jan. 28, with a report by New York Attorney General Letitia James that the state had undercounted coronavirus-related nursing home deaths. The subsequent pile-on has included several allegations of sexual harassment and groping; allegations that the governor’s family got special covid testing services; and a report that aides to the governor assisted with his book on leadership. Among the outlets that have pushed the stories forward are the Times-Union (Albany), the Times, the New York Post and The Washington Post.Yet Cuomo has managed to keep certain reporters on the beat from badgering him about his misdeeds. Late last year, the governor switched from in-person briefings to remote versions, in deference to worries about the holiday-season spread of covid. Since then, reporters access the governor via Zoom or phone-conferencing arrangements. The technology affords the governor’s staff a luxury unavailable during in-person sessions: They can mute reporters from whom they don’t want to hear, and greenlight those they suspect of having inquiries that align with the official agenda. “We have noticed a pattern that the governor’s press team tends to call on the same people, and to their benefit, not all of those people, those reporters, are going to be the ones that would make him uncomfortable,” says Dan Clark, managing editor of “New York Now,” a program on New York politics that airs on PBS stations statewide.In February, the Legislative Correspondents Association  — an outfit of  journalists who cover New York politics — pressed the governor to adopt a system like that of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, “where a variety of reporters are selected for questions and news outlets are guaranteed at least one question per week.” Quite a burn there, considering the much-talked-about enmity between the governor and the mayor. Clark, who was president of the LCA at the time, says that the governor’s people responded to the letter by vowing to do better, but that effort lasted “a very short amount of time.”Brendan Lyons, a Times-Union managing editor (and high school classmate of the Erik Wemple Blog), recalls that representatives from his paper have managed to place only one question before the governor in Zoom or call-in press availabilities over the past 13 months. The governor, says Lyons, “doesn’t seem to want to be asked difficult questions from journalists who … won’t accept a non-answer.” A spokesperson for the Associated Press says the last time a reporter from the wire service got called on was March 9 (a recent AP story documented Cuomo’s press pullback, noting that he’d held 17 conference calls with reporters in January, 10 in February and six in March). The New York Post reported last week that Cuomo hadn’t taken a question from the newspaper since before it revealed in February that Cuomo’s top aide had apologized to Democrats for withholding covid-related nursing home data. Jimmy Vielkind, who covers Albany for the Wall Street Journal, tweeted in early March that the last time he’d been able to pose a question to the governor in a news conference was in November.The control-freakish ways of Team Cuomo came into focus earlier this week, when New York Law Journal reporter Ryan Tarinelli asked the governor whether he’d resign if an ongoing investigation under James found that he’d sexually harassed women. Cuomo responded, “Let’s see what the review says, and then we’ll take it from there.” Tarinelli pursued with two follow-up questions, the second of which got cut off. Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, told the New York Post’s Bernadette Hogan and Bruce Golding that reporters get only one follow-up under an agreement between the LCA and the governor’s office. Clark said there’d never been such an agreement.Hogan, the current LCA president, said in a statement to the Erik Wemple Blog, “For more than 100 years, members of the Legislative Correspondents Association have regularly interacted with governors and other state officials as part of our reporting on New York governm",Cuomo has kept some reporters on the beat from whom they don't want to hear.

WSJ,andrew cuomo sex scandal,8,Cuomo to receive $5.1 million for his book on the coronavirus pandemic,https://t.co/O4zV1FlWRm?amp=1,"New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) will receive a total of $5.1 million for his book on the coronavirus pandemic, a contract driven by his national profile during the worst days of the virus and now seen through the prism of an investigation into his use of advisers to write the book.The book, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic,” was released in October. According to Rich Azzopardi, Cuomo’s director of communications and senior adviser, the book contract “calls for payment of $3,120,000 in the last taxable year and an additional $2 million over the following 2 years.” Details of the contract emerged Monday as Cuomo released his 2020 tax filings.According to Azzopardi, Cuomo received $1,537,508 from the $3,120,000 after expenses and taxes. Of that amount, Cuomo donated one-third to the United Way of New York State for “statewide covid relief and vaccination effort,” Azzopardi said. The remainder will go into a trust for Cuomo’s three daughters.In a letter to Cuomo dated Monday, United Way expressed “our sincere gratitude to you for such an extraordinary and generous contribution of $500,000.” The timing of Cuomo’s donation was not immediately clear.Cuomo aides worked on the $5.1 million book extensively, with many spending time in his office and in the mansion on the project. In one version of the book reviewed by The Washington Post, a Cuomo aide is asked to print a draft of the book labeled “MDR edits” — the initials of the governor’s top aide, Melissa DeRosa.The governor asked a number of advisers, including top state officials, to spend scores of hours to help write the book, even as the coronavirus raged through the state, four people previously told The Post.Andrew Cuomo declared the pandemic a ‘no-politics zone.’ Behind the scenes, he worked to burnish his own standing.A number of Cuomo’s aides disagreed with the decision to write a book during the pandemic, saying it could be viewed as inappropriately timed and political, two people said. Azzopardi last month told The Post that it was “not true” that aides at the time said the project was not a good idea.DeRosa was most involved in writing the book with Cuomo, while also running the governor’s office, people familiar with the matter said. Other aides who worked in the governor’s office were asked to print drafts of the book on government computers, according to the people with knowledge of the situation.Cuomo is under investigation by the New York State Assembly, the New York attorney general’s office and the FBI for alleged sexual misconduct as well as his administration’s alleged mishandling of data related to covid-19 deaths in the state’s nursing homes. The governor has denied any wrongdoing and rebuffed calls for his resignation.Cuomo stops short of apology over delay in data for nursing home coronavirus deathsCuomo has come under fire after nursing homes in the state accepted coronavirus-positive patients under a controversial directive from his administration. More than 9,000 recovering coronavirus patients were transferred to nursing homes early in the pandemic, the Associated Press reported.New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) in late January reported that nursing home resident deaths were “undercounted” by as much as 50 percent. Shortly after, the state’s reported death toll of nursing home residents increased by thousands when the health department shared more than 3,800 residents had died in hospitals.

WSJ,andrew cuomo sex scandal,9,The New York State Attorney General's office has been investigating multiple sexual harassment allegations against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo,https://t.co/H4ob5JDZKF?amp=1,"Investigators from the New York state attorney general’s office are expected to interview Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) on Saturday as part of the ongoing inquiry into the sexual harassment allegations against him, according to two people familiar with the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter.The questioning would come months after several of Cuomo’s former aides and employees accused him of sexual harassment and other inappropriate behavior. One former aide to the governor, Charlotte Bennett, told the New York Times that he asked her invasive personal questions that she interpreted as sexual advances. Another former aide, Lindsey Boylan, detailed allegations of sexual harassment against Cuomo spanning several years.Cuomo has apologized if anything he said may “have been misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation” but has denied ever inappropriately touching or propositioning anyone in his office.After mounting political pressure and calls for him to resign, Cuomo in February reversed course and said he would refer an investigation of the accusations against him to New York Attorney General Letitia James (D). He has refused to resign despite uproar from both Democrats and Republicans, including a majority of his state’s congressional delegation.A representative for James declined to comment Thursday. A spokesman for Cuomo said the latest developments suggested the inquiry was politically motivated.“We have said repeatedly that the Governor doesn’t want to comment on this review until he has cooperated, but the continued leaks are more evidence of the transparent political motivation of the Attorney General’s review,” Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi said in a statement.Debra Katz, an attorney for Bennett, said Saturday’s interview means the governor will not be able to deflect questions or “play with words.”Cuomo “has also demonstrated a jaw dropping ignorance of the sexual harassment law he signed into effect — without great fanfare — suggesting that his behavior is fine because he never meant to make women feel uncomfortable,” Katz said in a statement. “Will he admit to his inappropriate behavior, or will he continue his ridiculous lies and victim blaming? Which story will he tell this time?”James’s investigation into Cuomo’s workplace conduct comes amid several other probes that are scrutinizing aspects of the Cuomo administration, in which at least a dozen current and former staffers have been interviewed, The Washington Post reported last month.Read more:Andrew Cuomo’s administration contends with investigative scrutiny on multiple frontsCuomo’s behavior created ‘hostile, toxic’ workplace culture for decades, former aides sayCuomo to receive $5.1 million for his book on the coronavirus pandemicThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy",Investigators from the New York state attorney general's office are expected to interview Gov.

WSJ,andrew cuomo sex scandal,10,"Cuomo sexually harassed multiple female staffers in violation of state and federal law, New York attorney general concludes",https://t.co/vMrIThtoAy?amp=1,"New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo sexually harassed current and former state employees, creating a hostile work environment for women in violation of state and federal law, state Attorney General Letitia James announced Tuesday.Hours after the release of a 165-page report that detailed numerous allegations against Cuomo, President Biden said he believed the Democratic governor should resign, echoing a chorus of similar calls by other party officials. Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie (D) also  said Cuomo could no longer remain in office, adding that state lawmakers will move forward “expeditiously” with an ongoing impeachment investigation.Investigators laid out a devastating portrait of Cuomo’s behavior and extensive examples of unwanted  touching, including an incident last November in which Cuomo allegedly embraced an executive assistant and reached under her blouse to grab her breast. Witnesses also described an environment in the governor’s office that was abusive and vindictive, with one of the women who came forward targeted for retaliation through the release of her personnel file, investigators said.In all, the independent probe found that Cuomo harassed 11 women, including a state trooper whom the governor arranged to be put on his detail.“This investigation has revealed conduct that corrodes the very fabric and character of our state government,” James (D) said at a news conference.The findings mark a new low for a once-celebrated Democratic star, who won an Emmy in 2020 for his nationally televised  briefings during the pandemic, appeared on track for reelection to a fourth term in 2022 and was frequently discussed as a presidential contender. He is now isolated from his own party’s leadership, the result of a months-long investigation that was based on interviews with 179 people, including women who accused the governor of misconduct, Cuomo himself and a coterie of his top advisers.The probe was launched after multiple women accused Cuomo earlier this year of inappropriate personal comments or unwelcome physical contact.On Tuesday, James deflected questions from reporters about whether Cuomo should resign, saying “that decision is ultimately up to the governor of the state of New York.” She said her office was not making any criminal referrals but noted that the report was publicly available.Separately, Albany County District Attorney David Soares disclosed an ongoing criminal investigation of Cuomo by his office. “We will be formally requesting investigative materials obtained by the AG’s Office, and we welcome any victim to contact our office with additional information,” Soares said in a statement.In a video address Tuesday afternoon, Cuomo maintained a defiant posture. He said he would continue serving as governor and defended himself as a champion of women and victims of sexual harassment. “The facts are much different than what has been portrayed,” he said.“That’s not who I am,” the governor said of the depiction in the attorney general’s report.Cuomo denied the claim that he groped an executive assistant’s breast. “That never happened,” he said. He said other complainants sought to “unfairly characterize and weaponize everyday interactions,” noting his tendency to greet women and men warmly.After months of asking New Yorkers to withhold judgment until the attorney general’s report was released, his office released an extensive rebuttal document, calling the probe “an utterly biased investigation” that “willfully ignored evidence.”The document included eight pages of photographs of Cuomo kissing and hugging other officials in public, and a second exhibit filled with photographs of other prominent Democratic officials, including  Biden, Vice President Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former president Barack Obama doing the same.The governor also said he would bring in an “expert” to provide him and his office with sexual harassment training.The extent of the political fallout for Cuomo remains to be seen. When asked about the report Tuesday afternoon, Biden told reporters, “I think he should resign.”“Look, I’m not going to flyspeck this,” the president added. “I’m sure there are some embraces that were totally innocent. But apparently the attorney general decided there were things that weren’t.”Pelosi and three House Democrats from New York also called on the governor to step down, joining about a dozen from the state delegation who had previously done so.“We commend the brave women who came forward and spoke truth to power,” Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, Thomas Suozzi and Gregory W. Meeks said in a statement. “The time has come for Governor Andrew Cuomo to do the right thing for the people of New York State and resign.”The state’s two Democratic senators, Charles E.

WSJ,andrew cuomo sex scandal,11,“What he did to me was a crime”: Cuomo executive assistant who filed criminal complaint breaks silence,https://t.co/okabTuIsYY?amp=1,"The woman who filed a criminal complaint against New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) last week alleging he engaged in illegal sexual conduct has come forward publicly.Brittany Commisso was previously identified only as “Executive Assistant #1” in a report released Tuesday by state Attorney General Letitia James (D) after a lengthy investigation into numerous sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo. On Thursday, Commisso also filed a criminal complaint against Cuomo with the Albany County Sheriff’s Office but had remained anonymous.In a joint interview with CBS’s “This Morning” and the Albany Times Union that will air Monday, Commisso identifies herself as “Executive Assistant #1.” Previews of the interview were released by CBS throughout the day Sunday.When asked why she had filed the criminal complaint against Cuomo, Commisso told CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan “it was the right thing to do.”“The governor needs to be held accountable,” Commisso said.When asked to clarify if that meant seeing Cuomo charged with a crime, Commisso nodded in the affirmative.“What he did to me was a crime,” she told Duncan. “He broke the law.”Commisso told Duncan that Cuomo began giving her “hugs with kisses on the cheek” and at one point Cuomo hugged her, quickly turned his head and kissed her on the lips. Commisso also said Cuomo groped her — “he touched me, not only once, but twice” — and said she was too afraid to say anything.“I didn’t say anything this whole time. People don’t understand that this is the governor of the state of New York,” Commisso told Duncan. “There are troopers that are outside of the mansion and there are some mansion staff. Those troopers that are there — they are not there to protect me. They are there to protect him.”According to the attorney general’s report, Commisso told investigators that Cuomo harassed her both verbally and physically, including groping her breast in the governor’s mansion in Albany. Cuomo has denied the allegations.Commisso told investigators that one day, Cuomo allegedly told her it was “about time you showed some leg” when she wore a dress, and later asked if she had kissed or “fooled around” with someone other than her husband.At one point, the governor allegedly said to Commisso something like, “If you were single, the things I would do to you,” she recalled, per the attorney general’s report. In one incident, he allegedly asked her to take a selfie with him and then “moved his hand to grab her butt cheek and began to rub it,” the report said. Commisso told investigators she was shaking so much that the photos were blurry.In November, Commisso was dispatched to assist Cuomo at the executive mansion, according to the report. As she was leaving, he slammed the door shut and slid his hand up her blouse, cupping her breast, according to the investigation. “I remember thinking to myself who — I knew what just went on, I knew and he knew too that was wrong,” she told investigators. “And that I in no way, shape or form invited that nor did I ask for it. I didn’t want it. I feel like I was being taken advantage of.”Commisso told investigators from the attorney general’s office that she planned to take Cuomo’s actions “to her grave” but grew upset after hearing him deny inappropriately touching women.On Friday, a spokesman for the governor reiterated Cuomo’s denial that he groped the assistant and said that the office notified authorities after she told a supervisor about her experience.“As we said previously, we proactively made a referral nearly four months ago in accordance with state policies,” said Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor.Cuomo attorney Rita Glavin questioned the assistant’s account of the breast-groping in a news conference Friday. She said a reconstruction of the events of Nov. 16, a possible date of the incident given in the report, showed that the assistant was on a different floor from the governor for much of the day and that she did not leave abruptly but offered to continue working late at the mansion. The attorney general’s report notes that the assistant was not certain of the date of the incident. But Glavin said records show that Nov. 16 was the only day in November that the assistant entered the mansion.Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple said Saturday that his office would conduct a “very comprehensive investigation” into the criminal complaint filed against Cuomo, and he tried to keep the woman’s identity secret during a news conference.Apple also said his investigators would not be rushed or swayed by the high-profile nature of the case.Cuomo is facing a growing number of calls to resign, including from President Biden and other top Democrats, after numerous women accused him of sexual harassment and retaliation.“We treat victims the same. We investigate the same. This one has more eyes on it,” Apple said Saturday. “I’m not going to rush it because of who [Cuomo] is and I’m not going to delay it because of who he is.”Read more:In",Brittany Commisso was previously identified only as'Executive Assistant #1' by the state attorney general.com.com.

Reuters,texas power cut,1,White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that reports show that ‘failures in coal and natural gas’ contributed to the Texas power shortage that left millions of people without heat following a punishing winter storm,https://t.co/hkcSbezYJM?amp=1,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Go Nakamura, Brad Brooks5 Min ReadHOUSTON (Reuters) - Texas officials warned of “disasters within the disaster” of historic cold weather that left millions without heat for a third day on Wednesday, telling residents to prepare for energy to not return until the weekend.Residents in over 100 counties in Texas have been told to boil their drinking water as treatment plants continue to suffer from energy blackouts, officials said. Upward of 12 million people in the state -- the country’s second largest with a population of roughly 29 million -- have either have no drinking water on tap in their homes or have drinking water available only intermittently.Energy remains out for 2.7 million households, officials said. With freezing temperatures expected through the weekend, getting the lights back on will be a slow process, as the state has lost 40% of its generating capacity, with natural gas wells and pipelines, along with wind turbines, frozen shut.Hospitals in Houston, the state’s largest city, and elsewhere in Texas have reported they have no water. Nearly two dozens deaths have been attributed to the cold snap. Officials say they suspect many more people have died - but their bodies have not been discovered yet.On Wednesday evening, officials told residents in the most populous parts of the state to brace for another round of freezing rain and snow in the next 24 hours.The cold forced some residents to choose between staying in dark and cold homes, some with frozen or broken water pipes, or face possible COVID-19 exposure at local relief centers.“This is in many ways disasters within the disaster,” said Judge Lina Hidalgo, the top elected official in Harris County, which encompasses Houston. “The cascading effects are not going to go away.”Related CoverageGovernor Greg Abbott told a news conference that he expected a nuclear plant in south Texas to come back online Wednesday night, which along with coal-fired plants’ returning to operations should provide enough power for 400,000 homes.Abbott, a Republican, has demanded an investigation into the management of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), a cooperative responsible for 90% of the state’s electricity.Critics say ERCOT did not heed federal warnings after a similar cold-weather meltdown in 2011 to ensure that Texas’ energy infrastructure, which relies primarily on natural gas, was winterized.“Every source of power the state of Texas has access to has been compromised because of the cold temperature or because of equipment failures,” Abbott said.Laura Nowell, a 45-year-old mother of four in Waco, said her family has been without electricity since before dawn on Monday and has tried to keep warm by bundling up and sitting in their car for short stints.“We’ve never had this much cold. There is ice everywhere,” Nowell said, adding that she was frustrated by the lack of communication about rolling blackouts to conserve the power grid. “Tell me what’s going on. It’s silence.”‘WE’RE MAKESHIFTING’Texas’ deregulated energy market gives few financial incentives for operators to prepare for the rare bout of intensely cold weather, an issue critics have been pointing out for years.ERCOT, which instituted blackouts to cope with the surge in demand, asked that people focus on fixing the problem first before assigning blame. It said it hoped that soon customers would have to cope only with short rolling blackouts.“The best case at this point is that today or tomorrow we’re able to at least get back down to the point where all the consumers are experiencing outages that are no longer than 30 minutes to an hour at a time,” Dan Woodfin, ERCOT’s senior director of system operations, told a briefing.Austin Mayor Steve Adler, a Democrat, blamed the power failures on a lack of preparedness and also called for reforms.“We need to start taking a look at extreme weather. It’s not as unusual as it used to be,” Adler told MSNBC.The Federal Emergency Management Agency has supplied Texas with generators and is preparing to provide diesel fuel to help ensure availability of backup power, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for the state on Sunday.People were coping the best they could.Trilby Landry, a 57-year-old homeless man, was escaping the cold at the Gallery Furniture store in Houston, which opened its doors as a warming center, joining people who had fled homes with busted heating systems and water pipes.“We’re makeshifting,” Landry said in an phone interview. “Everybody’s in a whirlwind right now.

Reuters,texas power cut,3,Why a predictable cold snap crippled the Texas power grid,http://reut.rs/3qDOdbK,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Tim McLaughlin, Stephanie Kelly10 Min Read(This February 20 story refiles to fix reference to celsius temperature in fourth graph from bottom)(Reuters) - As Texans cranked up their heaters early Monday to combat plunging temperatures, a record surge of electricity demand set off a disastrous chain reaction in the state’s power grid.Wind turbines in the state’s northern Panhandle locked up. Natural gas plants shut down when frozen pipes and components shut off fuel flow. A South Texas nuclear reactor went dark after a five-foot section of uninsulated pipe seized up. Power outages quickly spread statewide - leaving millions shivering in their homes for days, with deadly consequences.It could have been far worse: Before dawn on Monday, the state’s grid operator was “seconds and minutes” away from an uncontrolled blackout for its 26 million customers, its CEO has said. Such a collapse occurs when operators lose the ability to manage the crisis through rolling blackouts; in such cases, it can take weeks or months to fully restore power to customers.Monday was one of the state’s coldest days in more than a century - but the unprecedented power crisis was hardly unpredictable after Texas had experienced a similar, though less severe, disruption during a 2011 cold snap. Still, Texas power producers failed to adequately winter-proof their systems. And the state’s grid operator underestimated its need for reserve power capacity before the crisis, then moved too slowly to tell utilities to institute rolling blackouts to protect against a grid meltdown, energy analysts, traders and economists said.Early signs of trouble came long before the forced outages. Two days earlier, for example, the grid suddenly lost 539 megawatts (MW) of power, or enough electricity for nearly 108,000 homes, according to operational messages disclosed by the state’s primary grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).The crisis stemmed from a unique confluence of weaknesses in the state’s power system.Texas is the only state in the continental United States with an independent and isolated grid. That allows the state to avoid federal regulation - but also severely limits its ability to draw emergency power from other grids. ERCOT also operates the only major U.S. grid that does not have a capacity market - a system that provides payments to operators to be on standby to supply power during severe weather events.After more than 3 million ERCOT customers lost power in a February 2011 freeze, federal regulators recommended that ERCOT prepare for winter with the same urgency as it does the peak summer season. They also said that, while ERCOT’s reserve power capacity looked good on paper, it did not take into account that many generation units could get knocked offline by freezing weather.“There were prior severe cold weather events in the Southwest in 1983, 1989, 2003, 2006, 2008, and 2010,” Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and North American Electric Reliability Corp staff summarized after investigating the state’s 2011 rolling blackouts. “Extensive generator failures overwhelmed ERCOT’s reserves, which eventually dropped below the level of safe operation.”ERCOT spokeswoman Leslie Sopko did not comment in detail about the causes of the power crisis but said the grid’s leadership plans to re-evaluate the assumptions that go into its forecasts.The freeze was easy to see coming, said Jay Apt, co-director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center.“When I read that this was a black-swan event, I just have to wonder whether the folks who are saying that have been in this business long enough that they forgot everything, or just came into it,” Apt said. “People need to recognize that this sort of weather is pretty common.”This week’s cold snap left 4.5 million ERCOT customers without power. More than 14.5 million Texans endured a related water-supply crisis as pipes froze and burst. About 65,000 customers remained without power as of Saturday afternoon, even as temperatures started to rise, according to website PowerOutage.US.State health officials have linked more than two dozen deaths to the power crisis. Some died from hypothermia or possible carbon monoxide poisoning caused by portable generators running in basements and garages without enough ventilation. Officials say they suspect the death count will rise as more bodies are discovered.In the central Texas city of Austin, the state capital, the minimum February temperature usually falls between 42 and 48 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 9 degrees Celsius). This past week, temperatures fell as low as 6 degrees Fahrenheit (-14 degrees Celsius).In November, ERCOT assured that the grid was prepared to handle such a dire scenario.“We studied a range of potential risks under both normal and extreme conditions, and believe there is sufficient generation to adequately serve our customers,” said ERCOT’s manager of resource adequacy, Pete Warnken, in a r",Texas is the only state in the continental United States with an independent and isolated grid.

Reuters,texas power cut,4,Texas power crisis deepens as more companies skip payments due to grid operator,http://reut.rs/304jSHS,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Gary McWilliams3 Min ReadHOUSTON (Reuters) - Texas energy companies failed to pay another $345 million for electricity and other services incurred during last month’s cold snap, the operator of the state’s grid said on Monday.The state’s deregulated electricity market was thrown into turmoil last month as 48% of its generating plants went offline, fueling up to $9,000 per megawatt hour (mwh) spot rates and $25,000 per mwh service fees. Those charges drove one provider into bankruptcy on Monday.In all, electricity prices on the state’s wholesale market soared by $47 billion for the about five-day period when cold weather drove up demand and generating plants failed, estimated Carrie Bivens, a vice president at Potomac Economics, which monitors the Texas power market.Her figure does not include add-on fees or payment defaults, which are significant and are spread to all companies that use grid services under ERCOT rules, she said.“It is a lot of zeros,” said Bivens of the additional fees.In all, electricity providers skipped out on $2.46 billion in power and service charges, grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) said. It applied $800 million from collateral and other accounts to reduce the cumulative shortfall to $1.66 billion.ERCOT did not disclose which companies failed to pay the bills, but said it will begin naming firms and the amounts they have failed to pay in the future.The state-supervised operator acts as a clearinghouse, collecting cash from marketers that buy power, and sending it to the companies that furnish electrons to its grid.Texas could cut about $2 billion off the burden facing municipal utilities, marketers and generators by reducing some fees, said Bivens. The governor also could apply a portion of the state emergency fund to cover some charges.On Monday, electricity provider Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc., the state’s largest and oldest power wholesale firm, filed for bankruptcy citing an $1.8 billion debt due to ERCOT. The filing underscored the financial stress on power marketers and utilities from the pricing turmoil.A spokeswoman for Governor Greg Abbott declined to comment on Monday’s bankruptcy filing or on proposals that the state’s Public Utility Commission roll back fees that skyrocketed during the blackout.Abbott is monitoring the situation “as ERCOT and their financial advisers work to ensure that the ability to provide electricity is not interrupted,” spokeswoman Renae Eze said.Reporting by Gary McWilliams; Editing by Rosalba O’Brien and Stephen Coates","State's deregulated electricity market was thrown into turmoil last month.

Reuters,texas power cut,5,Texas power grid CEO fired after deadly February blackouts: AP,http://reut.rs/3effaPw,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Kanishka Singh, Ann Maria Shibu3 Min Read(Reuters) - Texas’ power grid operator ousted chief executive Bill Magness on Wednesday, as the fallout continues from a deadly blackout last month that left residents without heat, power or water for days.His departure followed fierce criticism by state lawmakers of the handling of the crisis by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which has led one large electricity provider to seek bankruptcy and put several others near to it.The mid-February storm temporarily knocked out up to half the state’s generating plants, triggering outages that killed dozens and pushed power prices to 10 times the normal rate.“ERCOT’s decision to oust CEO Bill Magness signals accountability for the disaster that swept through our state two weeks ago,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement on Twitter.“(This step) offers the opportunity for new leadership that can more efficiently prepare and direct our state’s resources when dangerous weather strikes,” he added.Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who earlier this week called for the heads of ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission to resign, also welcomed the move.The legislature now can begin “fixing what went wrong,” Patrick said.ERCOT said in a statement cited by multiple media organizations that its board had directed that Magness be given a 60 days’ termination notice. The board would begin an immediate search for a new CEO.Magness worked at ERCOT for more than a decade and became its CEO and president in 2016 after working as its general counsel, the Texas Tribune newspaper reported.Brad Jones, former head of New York’s power grid, is the leading candidate to replace Magness as ERCOT’s CEO, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the board’s thinking.Magness was grilled for hours last week for leaving power prices at up to 450 times the usual rate after the threat to the state’s grid had ended.Seven of ERCOT’s 15 directors have resigned in the last week and the head of the state’s Public Utility Commission, which supervised ERCOT, resigned on Monday.The winter storm caused widespread blackouts across Texas, a state unaccustomed to extreme cold, knocking out power to more than 4 million people at its peak.Reporting by Kanishka Singh and Ann Maria Shibu in Bengaluru; Editing by Gary McWilliams and Richard Pullin",Texas's power grid operator ousted chief executive Bill Magness on Wednesday.

Power outages can be dangerous for those unprepared for such intense winter chill.",https://t.co/86auI8omaW?amp=1,"By Scottie Andrew, CNNUpdated 4:17 PM ET, Mon February 15, 2021  (CNN)Texas is colder than it's been in decades, one of at least 25 states under a winter weather advisory during this week's historic cold outbreak. CNN's Christina Maxouris contributed to this report. But as Texans scramble to stay warm, rolling power outages have begun across the state following high demand. Millions of customers across the US have lost power, with much of those outages occurring in Texas. Power outages can be dangerous for those unprepared for such intense winter chill. If you're among the Texans whose power has gone out or will go out at some point this week, here's what you need to know to stay warm and safe this week. Stay homeStaying indoors is your best bet at staying safe during a winter power outage, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Stay off the roads if you can -- icy conditions could lead to car accidents. Just last week, at least nine people were killed in car crashes triggered by winter storms in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, including six who died in the 133-car pileup in Fort Worth.Take stock of the essentialsIn case the power outage lasts a few days, you should have the following on hand: Extra food and water: A three- to seven-day supply is a good standardFlashlight and extra batteriesBattery-powered radioExtra medicineFirst-aid suppliesIf you need to make a trip outside, keep it as brief as you can, and layer up, the CDC says. Check with your local emergency authorities to make sure it's safe to drive or travel in the cold. Stay warmLayer up -- it's going to get cold. In extreme cold, the Houston Office of Emergency Management recommends wearing at least three layers of tops, plus an outer layer to block out wind, and two layers of bottoms. A hat, gloves and a warm face mask are musts, too. The CDC recommends warming up with extra blankets, sleeping bags and winter coats. It's not safe, though, to keep blankets and other flammable materials near alternate sources of warmth like a portable space heater. Keep the heaters in an area clear of flammable fabrics. If you're using a fireplace, first make sure it's properly vented to the outside and won't leak gas into your home. You should keep it stocked with dry firewood -- not paper, the CDC says -- throughout the power outage.To keep in heat, close blinds and curtains and shut doors to rooms to avoid ""wasting heat,"" the National Weather Service recommends. Stuffing towels in the cracks under doors can keep some of the chill out of your home, and eating and drinking throughout the power outage will help keep your body warm. Keep your food & water supply safeAvoid opening your fridge or freezer during the power outage to keep your food cold. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a fridge can keep food cold during an outage for about four hours, and a freezer will keep its temperature for about 48 hours. Fill coolers with ice, if necessary, to keep food from spoiling. Some water purification systems may not function fully when the power goes out, the CDC warns. You can check with local officials to make sure your water is safe -- they should give you specific recommendations for treating water in your area.Be careful of carbon monoxideGenerators can release poisonous carbon monoxide if you use them inside your home. If you're using one this week, keep it outside, about 20 feet away from your home, the CDC advises. You should never use a gas stove or oven to heat your home, according to Ready.gov, the US government's online disaster planning resource. If it's safe, go somewhere warmIf it's safe for you to travel to a shelter, be sure to wear a mask or layer two masks and bring extras in case your stay is extended. These locations should be well-ventilated, though social distancing is still advised, according to Ready.gov. Know the signs of hypothermiaBabies, older adults and unhoused people are the most vulnerable to hypothermia. If you're worried about people in these groups, look for the signs: Confusion, shivering, difficult speaking, sleepiness and stiff muscles in adults, and bright red skin and low energy in babies, according to the CDC. If you fear someone in your household has hypothermia, call for medical help. If they can't immediately arrive, try to warm them up yourself with blankets, food and water and an alternate heat source. Conserve power if you still have itStart by turning off and unplugging nonessential lights and appliances, and don't use large appliances like ovens or washing machines if you can avoid it, the Houston Office of Emergency Management suggests. Turn down your thermostat to 68 degrees or lower -- if too many people crank up the heat, the demand could trigger another blackout. During the day, if it's sunny, open your blinds so the sun can heat your home, but close them at night to prevent losing heat. Check on your loved onesWhen safe to do so, check in with the people around you to make su",Texas is one of at least 25 states under a winter weather advisory.

Anyone can read what you share.By Brad PlumerHuge winter storms plunged large parts of the central and southern United States into an energy crisis this week, with frigid blasts of Arctic weather crippling electric grids and leaving millions of Americans without power amid dangerously cold temperatures.The grid failures were most severe in Texas, where more than four million people woke up Tuesday morning to rolling blackouts. Separate regional grids in the Southwest and Midwest also faced serious strain. As of Tuesday afternoon, at least 23 people nationwide had died in the storm or its aftermath.Analysts have begun to identify key factors behind the grid failures in Texas. Record-breaking cold weather spurred residents to crank up their electric heaters and pushed power demand beyond the worst-case scenarios that grid operators had planned for. At the same time, a large fraction of the state’s gas-fired power plants were knocked offline amid icy conditions, with some plants suffering fuel shortages as natural gas demand spiked. Many of Texas’ wind turbines also froze and stopped working.The crisis sounded an alarm for power systems throughout the country. Electric grids can be engineered to handle a wide range of severe conditions — as long as grid operators can reliably predict the dangers ahead. But as climate change accelerates, many electric grids will face extreme weather events that go far beyond the historical conditions those systems were designed for, putting them at risk of catastrophic failure.While scientists are still analyzing what role human-caused climate change may have played in this week’s winter storms, it is clear that global warming poses a barrage of additional threats to power systems nationwide, including fiercer heat waves and water shortages.Measures that could help make electric grids more robust — such as fortifying power plants against extreme weather, or installing more backup power sources — could prove expensive. But as Texas shows, blackouts can be extremely costly, too. And, experts said, unless grid planners start planning for increasingly wild and unpredictable climate conditions, grid failures will happen again and again.“It’s essentially a question of how much insurance you want to buy,” said Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems engineer at Princeton University. “What makes this problem even harder is that we’re now in a world where, especially with climate change, the past is no longer a good guide to the future. We have to get much better at preparing for the unexpected.”Texas’ main electric grid, which largely operates independently from the rest of the country, has been built with the state’s most common weather extremes in mind: soaring summer temperatures that cause millions of Texans to turn up their air-conditioners all at once.While freezing weather is rarer, grid operators in Texas have also long known that electricity demand can spike in the winter, particularly after damaging cold snaps in 2011 and 2018. But this week’s winter storms, which buried the state in snow and ice, and led to record-cold temperatures, surpassed all expectations — and pushed the grid to its breaking point.Texas’ grid operators had anticipated that, in the worst case, the state would use 67 gigawatts of electricity during the winter peak. But by Sunday evening, power demand had surged past that level. As temperatures dropped, many homes were relying on older, inefficient electric heaters that consume more power.The problems compounded from there, with frigid weather on Monday disabling power plants with capacity totaling more than 30 gigawatts. The vast majority of those failures occurred at thermal power plants, like natural gas generators, as plummeting temperatures paralyzed plant equipment and soaring demand for natural gas left some plants struggling to obtain sufficient fuel. A number of the state’s power plants were also offline for scheduled maintenance in preparation for the summer peak.The state’s fleet of wind farms also lost up to 4.5 gigawatts of capacity at times, as many turbines stopped working in cold and icy conditions, though this was a smaller part of the problem.In essence, experts said, an electric grid optimized to deliver huge quantities of power on the hottest days of the year was caught unprepared when temperatures plummeted.While analysts are still working to untangle all of the reasons behind Texas’ grid failures, some have also wondered whether the unique way the state manages its largely deregulated electricity system may have played a role. In the mid-1990s, for instance, Texas decided against paying energy producers to hold a fixed number of backup power plants in reserve, instead lettin",Huge winter storms plunged large parts of the central and southern U.S. into an energy crisis this week.

Temperatures across the middle of the country had plummeted to lows not felt in a century or more, with measurements of minus 14 in Oklahoma City and minus 20 in Fayetteville, Ark., even as a new winter storm was building in the southern Plains.At least 23 people have died since winter weather began wreaking havoc last week, some from the cold itself and some from attempts to escape it. And almost four million customers across the country remained without electricity on Tuesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us, which aggregates live power data from utilities.More than 3.5 million of those outages were in Texas, where many people had been without power for hours or even days in freezing temperatures. State leaders, including Gov. Greg Abbott, expressed sharp criticism of the operation of the state’s power grid, and the Texas House speaker announced a legislative hearing looking into the widespread power failures.Maps show where frigid temperatures led to power outages, many in places unaccustomed to such severe cold.The disruptions caused problems at water treatment plants, leading to boil water advisories for hundreds of thousands of people across Texas, from Fort Worth down to the Rio Grande Valley. Some customers lost water altogether, forced to flush their toilets with melting snow.By early Tuesday afternoon, Southwest Power Pool, which manages the electrical grid across 17 Central and Western states, had stopped ordering controlled rolling cutoffs of power service to customers as the energy supply began meeting the extreme demand, a spokesman said.The storm also severely disrupted the distribution of the coronavirus vaccine, forcing vaccination sites to close across the South and hampering the shipments of doses.The brutal cold in the middle of the country seemed to defy a trend of ever-milder winters, but the frigid temperatures in Texas could be a consequence of global warming.

Greg Abbott called for an emergency reform of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, saying the operator of the state’s power grid “has been anything but reliable over the past 48 hours.”Analysts have begun to identify a few key factors behind the grid failures in Texas. Record-breaking cold weather spurred residents to crank up their electric heaters and pushed demand for electricity beyond the worst-case scenarios that grid operators had planned for. At the same time, many of the state’s gas-fired power plants were knocked offline amid icy conditions, ",Temperatures across the country have plummeted to lows not felt in a century or more.

Schwartz, an executive vice president and the chief innovation officer at Houston Methodist, which operates seven hospitals around the country’s fourth-largest city. Water, she said, was in such short supply that health workers were using bottled water for chemotherapy treatments.The water challenges extended to about 13 million Texans who are being told to boil water for their safety after burst pipes and broken water mains. Another winter storm on Thursday brought freezing rain, snow and temperatures that were “much below average,” a gut punch for people who have resorted to stoves, barbecue grills and gasoline generators to stay themselves warm.Days of glacial weather have left at least 38 people dead nationwide, made many roads impassable, disrupted vaccine distribution and blanketed nearly three-quarters of the continental United States in snow.In Texas, hospitals such as St. David’s South Austin Medical Center said they were transferring some patients to other facilities as they desperately tried to conserve resources. Parts of the ceiling collapsed at the Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas after a pipe burst, spraying water directly into the emergency room.Some of the challenges facing the hospitals are tied to problems cascading through the state’s beleaguered health care system since the storm and power grid crisis. An influx of dialysis patients, for instance, is placing stress on hospital emergency rooms because many dialysis centers — which require electricity, heat and large amounts of filtered water to properly provide care — are temporarily closed.At one of Houston Methodist’s hospitals, doctors turned an old intensive care unit into a makeshift dialysis unit, transferring 42 patients out of the cramped emergency room on Wednesday. And in parts of East Texas, health care workers are growing so alarmed about patients going without dialysis treatment over the past week that they are asking local police departments to do welfare checks.“This can be a death sentence for some of our patients,” said Kara McClure, a social worker in the Tyler area.— David Montgomery and Simon Romero transcriptSince our press conference yesterday, power has been restored to nearly two million homes across Texas. There continue to be approximately 325,000 Texans without power. However, those without power are not without power because of the lack of ability to generate power. Instead, those without power are being impacted either by power lines that are down or the need to manually reconnect the premises to power. I also had a call earlier today with water providers to work on additional ways to expedite getting clean water to Texas. We are in the process, as we speak, of evaluating waivers, as well as executive orders, that can be used to speed up that process.

All four of them live outside of Texas, a point of contention for critics.",https://t.co/8xCbhcHzuB?amp=1,"AdvertisementSupported byThe chairwoman and four other board members of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas stepped down after millions were left without electricity during freezing temperatures.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Rick RojasFive officials will resign from the board overseeing the Texas power grid after it was pushed to the brink of collapse by the recent winter storm, leaving millions without electricity during some of the coldest temperatures the state has experienced in a generation.The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the board that governs the flow of power for more than 26 million people in the state, has been blamed for the widespread outages, prompting the governor, lawmakers and federal officials to begin inquiries into the system’s failures, particularly in preparation for cold weather.The five board members, who intend to resign at the conclusion of a meeting scheduled for Wednesday morning, were all from outside of Texas, a point of contention for critics who questioned the wisdom of outsiders playing such an influential role in the state’s infrastructure.In a statement on Tuesday filed with the Public Utility Commission, four of the board members said they were stepping down “to allow state leaders a free hand with future direction and to eliminate distractions.” In a footnote, the filing added that a fifth member was also resigning.Those departing are Sally Talberg, the chairwoman and a former state utility regulator who lives in Michigan; Peter Cramton, the vice chairman and an economics professor at the University of Cologne in Germany and the University of Maryland; Terry Bulger, a retired banking executive who lives in Illinois; Raymond Hepper, a former official with the agency overseeing the power grid in New England; and Vanessa Anesetti-Parra, who oversees regulatory affairs for a company headquartered in Canada. Another person who was supposed to fill a vacant seat, Craig S. Ivey, has withdrawn from the 16-member board.The board became the target of blame and scrutiny after the winter storm last week brought the state’s electric grid precariously close to a complete blackout that could have taken months to recover from. In a last-minute effort to avert that, the council, known as ERCOT, ordered rolling outages that plunged much of the state into darkness and caused electricity prices to skyrocket. Some customers had bills well over $10,000.The weather crippled the system as power plants were knocked offline and pumps used to produce the natural gas needed to fuel them froze over.State officials have said ERCOT had offered assurances that the power infrastructure was prepared to endure winter conditions.“But those assurances proved to be devastatingly false,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement, adding, “When Texans were in desperate need of electricity, ERCOT failed to do its job and Texans were left shivering in their homes without power.”As the state was reeling from the crisis, the realization that some board members lived out of state became a source of outrage, so much so that ERCOT initially took down information about them from its website. Officials said the members had been harassed and threatened.One state lawmaker said he was weighing proposing legislation that would bar people who were not Texas residents from serving on the board.“If you’re not living here, if you’re not experiencing what we’re experiencing, and yet you’re charged with making decisions on our behalf, that’s unacceptable,” Jeff Leach, a state representative whose district covers a swath of the Dallas suburbs, said in a recent interview.The resignations come as the State Legislature prepares to hold hearings on the power outages on Thursday. The Harris County attorney, whose jurisdiction includes Houston, said on Tuesday that he was initiating a civil investigation examining decisions made by ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission, among others, and the district attorney in Travis County, which includes Austin, said he was opening a criminal investigation.In a statement, ERCOT said, “We look forward to working with the Texas Legislature, and we thank the outgoing board members for their service.”The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said late Monday that its enforcement division would review wholesale natural gas and electricity market activity in Texas, presumably to determine whether there was any illegal anticompetitive or price manipulations.The failures of the power system drove up wholesale electricity prices from $1,200 per megawatt-hour to about $9,000.Energy analysts said the failure involved not only oversight from ERCOT but electrical providers around the state that did not prepare their systems for harsh weather conditions.“Heads had to roll but I don’t think it will change anything,” said Michael E. Webber, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.

British billionaire Richard Branson announced he would attempt to go to space on July 11, just nine days before the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos. But Branson has dismissed the notion of it being a ""race.""",https://t.co/a9pvfufEmh?amp=1,"By Jackie Wattles, CNN BusinessUpdated 3:46 PM ET, Fri July 2, 2021 New York (CNN Business)Richard Branson, the British billionaire and entrepreneur, announced late Thursday that he would attempt to go to space on July 11, just nine days before the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos, will make his own spaceflight. But even as he effectively cut ahead of Bezos, Branson dismissed the notion of it being a ""race"" and went so far as to invite his fellow billionaire to come watch.The Virgin Galactic founder told CNN Business in a Friday interview that his surprise announcement about making his long-awaited trip to outer space next week on a Virgin Galactic spaceplane was a coincidence, and had nothing to do with Bezos's timing. Bezos said last month he would fly on July 20 aboard a rocket built by his own space company, Blue Origin.""I don't know for sure exactly when Jeff Bezos is going, he may decide to go before us, but I honestly don't see this as a space race,"" Branson told CNN Business' Rachel Crane. ""I would love for Jeff to come and see our flight off whenever it takes place. I would love to go and watch him go in his flight, and I think both of us will wish each other well.""Since the early 2000s, Branson and Bezos have been vying to develop, test and launch suborbital rockets that can take wealthy thrillseekers on brief, 2,300-mile-per-hour rides a few dozen miles above Earth. And their efforts have long been framed as a ""billionaire space race."" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's name is also often thrown around in the ""space race"" game, but the orbital rockets SpaceX builds are far more powerful than the suborbital tourism rockets built by Branson and Bezos, requiring more infrastructure to launch. Musk has said little about his personal space ambitions beyond that he'd ""like to die on Mars — just not on impact.""In interviews, Branson has repeatedly said he's not interested in any sort of cosmic race. But his plan to get to space on July 11 was not part of the testing roadmap laid out earlier this year by Virgin Galactic. He told CNN, however, that any suggestion that Virgin Galactic may be compromising safety in an effort to get Branson to space before Bezos is ""completely wrong.""""You've got to remember that Virgin Galactic has people on every spaceflight...The fact that I'm willing to fly with those people shows confidence,"" Branson said. ""I think the least the founder of the company can do is go up there and fly with his people.""Virgin Galactic's space plane, called SpaceShipTwo, has been in development for well over a decade, and it functions much differently than Blue Origin's fully autonomous rocket that lifts off vertically from a launch pad. SpaceShipTwo takes off from an airplane runway attached beneath the wing of a massive, custom-designed quad-jet double-fuselage mothership known as WhiteKnightTwo. Once the mothership reaches about 40,000 feet, the rocket-powered plane is dropped from in between WhiteKnightTwo's fuselages, and fires up its engine and swoops directly upward, accelerating up to more than three times the speed of sound, or 2,300 miles an hour.Once it reaches the very top of its flight path, it hangs, suspended in microgravity, as it flips onto its belly before gliding back down to a runway landing. From takeoff to landing, the whole trip takes roughly an hour. Virgin Galactic had planned to start flying customers years ago, but its development program was set back by several mishaps, including a 2014 test fight accident that resulted in the death of a co-pilot.Still, more than 600 people have agreed to pay between $200,000 and $250,000 to reserve a seat aboard one of the company's space planes, and Virgin Galactic said it's expecting a massive influx of new ticket orders when it reopens sales — at a higher price point — in the near future.Bezos' Blue Origin has not yet begun selling tickets to the general public, but one seat on Bezos' upcoming flight will be taken by an auction winner who agreed to pay $28 million. The auction winner has not yet been named, but he or she will fly alongside Bezos, his brother Mark Bezos, and Wally Funk, an 82-year-old pilot and one of the ""Mercury 13"" women who trained to go to space in the 1960s but was never given the opportunity to fly.After Branson's flight, Virgin Galactic is expected to conduct one more test flight that will host an Italian Air Force research mission before beginning commercial operations.",Richard Branson says he will attempt to go to space on July 11.

CNN,richard branson space travel,2,"Is Sir Richard Branson nervous about his upcoming trip to space on July 11, nine days before billionaire Jeff Bezos launches on July 20? ""I'm not nervous. I'm incredibly excited,"" he says.",https://t.co/tVLpLnqHtd?amp=1,"By Jackie Wattles, CNN BusinessUpdated 3:46 PM ET, Fri July 2, 2021 New York (CNN Business)Richard Branson, the British billionaire and entrepreneur, announced late Thursday that he would attempt to go to space on July 11, just nine days before the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos, will make his own spaceflight. But even as he effectively cut ahead of Bezos, Branson dismissed the notion of it being a ""race"" and went so far as to invite his fellow billionaire to come watch.The Virgin Galactic founder told CNN Business in a Friday interview that his surprise announcement about making his long-awaited trip to outer space next week on a Virgin Galactic spaceplane was a coincidence, and had nothing to do with Bezos's timing. Bezos said last month he would fly on July 20 aboard a rocket built by his own space company, Blue Origin.""I don't know for sure exactly when Jeff Bezos is going, he may decide to go before us, but I honestly don't see this as a space race,"" Branson told CNN Business' Rachel Crane. ""I would love for Jeff to come and see our flight off whenever it takes place. I would love to go and watch him go in his flight, and I think both of us will wish each other well.""Since the early 2000s, Branson and Bezos have been vying to develop, test and launch suborbital rockets that can take wealthy thrillseekers on brief, 2,300-mile-per-hour rides a few dozen miles above Earth. And their efforts have long been framed as a ""billionaire space race."" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's name is also often thrown around in the ""space race"" game, but the orbital rockets SpaceX builds are far more powerful than the suborbital tourism rockets built by Branson and Bezos, requiring more infrastructure to launch. Musk has said little about his personal space ambitions beyond that he'd ""like to die on Mars — just not on impact.""In interviews, Branson has repeatedly said he's not interested in any sort of cosmic race. But his plan to get to space on July 11 was not part of the testing roadmap laid out earlier this year by Virgin Galactic. He told CNN, however, that any suggestion that Virgin Galactic may be compromising safety in an effort to get Branson to space before Bezos is ""completely wrong.""""You've got to remember that Virgin Galactic has people on every spaceflight...The fact that I'm willing to fly with those people shows confidence,"" Branson said. ""I think the least the founder of the company can do is go up there and fly with his people.""Virgin Galactic's space plane, called SpaceShipTwo, has been in development for well over a decade, and it functions much differently than Blue Origin's fully autonomous rocket that lifts off vertically from a launch pad. SpaceShipTwo takes off from an airplane runway attached beneath the wing of a massive, custom-designed quad-jet double-fuselage mothership known as WhiteKnightTwo. Once the mothership reaches about 40,000 feet, the rocket-powered plane is dropped from in between WhiteKnightTwo's fuselages, and fires up its engine and swoops directly upward, accelerating up to more than three times the speed of sound, or 2,300 miles an hour.Once it reaches the very top of its flight path, it hangs, suspended in microgravity, as it flips onto its belly before gliding back down to a runway landing. From takeoff to landing, the whole trip takes roughly an hour. Virgin Galactic had planned to start flying customers years ago, but its development program was set back by several mishaps, including a 2014 test fight accident that resulted in the death of a co-pilot.Still, more than 600 people have agreed to pay between $200,000 and $250,000 to reserve a seat aboard one of the company's space planes, and Virgin Galactic said it's expecting a massive influx of new ticket orders when it reopens sales — at a higher price point — in the near future.Bezos' Blue Origin has not yet begun selling tickets to the general public, but one seat on Bezos' upcoming flight will be taken by an auction winner who agreed to pay $28 million. The auction winner has not yet been named, but he or she will fly alongside Bezos, his brother Mark Bezos, and Wally Funk, an 82-year-old pilot and one of the ""Mercury 13"" women who trained to go to space in the 1960s but was never given the opportunity to fly.After Branson's flight, Virgin Galactic is expected to conduct one more test flight that will host an Italian Air Force research mission before beginning commercial operations.",Richard Branson says he will attempt to go to space on July 11.

He founded Virgin Galactic in 2004 with the goal of creating a winged spacecraft capable of taking up to eight people, including two pilots and six passengers, on rocket-powered flights that reach more than 50 miles above Earth, which the US government considers the boundary marking outer space. Virgin Galactic's VSS Unity, as the spaceplane is called, conducted more than 20 test flights, three of which reached the edge of space and made five Virgin Galactic employees into pin-carrying astronauts. But Branson's flight made him the first billionaire founder of space company to actually travel into space aboard a vehicle he helped fund. Branson's flight took off from Spaceport America in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. Virgin Galactic's livestream is here, and CNN Business will also be sharing the livestream and our running live blog with updates is here.Here's everything you need to know. Who went?Branson brought three colleagues along for the ride. They include:Beth Moses, who holds the title of Chief Astronaut Instructor at Virgin Galactic and will handle the training for all of the company's future customers. She's flown to space on VSS Unity once before, during a 2019 test flight. Moses, an aerospace engineer, won't just be along for the ride. She'll be ensuring her fellow passengers stay safe and ensure that Virgin Galactic collects all the data it needs because this flight will be, at the end of the day, still a test flight.Colin Bennett, who is the company's lead operations engineer. Bennett will help evaluate the overall experience and ensure the cabin equipment is in good shape. Sirisha Bandla, Virgin Galactic's vice president of government affairs and research. Bandla will be on board for the science. Virgin Galactic frequently flies experiments to makes use of the microgravity environment, and on this flight Bandla will be handling a University of Florida research project that involves handling ""handheld fixation tubes,"" according to the company.Virgin Galactic says that Branson's job was to use his ""observations from his flight training and spaceflight experience to enhance the journey for all future astronaut customers,"" according to the company. What happened?When most people think about spaceflight, they think about an astronaut circling the Earth, floating in space, for at least a few days. That is not what Branson was doing on VSS Unity, which is the only operational SpaceShipTwo spaceplane that Virgin Galactic has in its arsenal, though the company is building others. VSS Unity's flight path was a wild trip, in general. Rather than taking off vertically from a launch pad like most rockets, the space plane took off from a runway near Virgin Galactic's ""spaceport"" in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico on Sunday morning. (The former town of Hot Springs, New Mexico, changed its named to Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, as part of a 1950s publicity stunt for a radio show and the name has stuck ever since).VSS Unity was affixed to a massive mothership, called WhiteKnightTwo, that looks like two sleek jets attached at the tip of their wings. The mothership took about 45 minutes to cruise along and slowly climb with VSS Unity to about 50,000 feet. Then, when the pilots gave the go-ahead, SpaceShipTwo dropped from between WhiteKnightTwo's two fuselages and fired up its rocket engine, swooping directly upward and roaring past the speed of sound. VSS Unity is a suborbital space plane, meaning it didn't drum up enough speed to escape the pull of Earth's gravity. Instead, it'll rocket at more than three times the speed of sound — about 2,300 miles per hour — to more than 50 miles above ground. At the top of the flight path, Branson and his fellow passengers briefly experienced weightlessness. It's like an extended version of the weightlessness you experience when you reach the peak of a roller coaster hill, just before gravity brings your cart — or, in Branson's case, your space plane -— gliding back down toward the ground.After about a minute the engine shut off, leaving the spacecraft and the passengers suspended in microgravity as SpaceShipTwo rolled onto its belly and offered the passengers sweeping views of the Earth below and the ink",Richard Branson is the first Virgin Galactic founder to fly into space.

Unlike traditional space travel where astronauts circle the Earth and float in space for days, Virgin Galactic's flights are brief, up-and-down trips. But the spacecraft will go more than 50 miles above Earth, which the US government considers to mark the boundary of outer space.From CNN's Jackie WattlesThe Virgin Galactic's VSS Unity has officially taken off.

Attached beneath its massive, twin-fuselaged mothership, dubbed WhiteKnightTwo, the vehicle took to the skies at 8:30 am MT and climbed to about 50,000 feet in the air.Just after 9:15 in the morning, the SpaceShipTwo detached from its mothership and dropped momentarily before its engine screamed to life and the vehicle swooped upward. On board, the passengers experienced up to three Gs of force from the burst of extreme acceleration and watched the blue sky fade into the star-speckled darkness of outer space. At the top of the flight path, more than 50 miles high, the vehicle was suspended in weightlessness for a few minutes, allowing the passengers to enjoy panoramic views of the Earth and space as SpaceShipTwo flipped onto its belly. It then deployed its feathering system, which curls the plane's wings upward, mimicking the shape of a badminton shuttlecock, to turn the spaceship rightward as it flew back into the Earth's thick atmosphere and glided back down to a runway landing. As Branson floated around in microgravity, he taped a message using cameras onboard the space plane: ""To all you kids out there — I was once a child with a dream, looking up to the stars. Now I'm an adult in a spaceship...If we can do this, just imagine what you can do,"" he said.This flight marked only the fourth test flight of the vehicle that reached the edge of space. Surrounding SpaceShipTwo's takeoff was — in typical Branson fashion -— a high-production party with friends, family, employees and a few VIPs in attendance. Earlier on Sunday, Branson tweeted a picture of himself and a barefoot Elon Musk hanging out. Grammy-nominated artist Khalid is also expected to perform an as-yet-unreleased song on an outdoor stage. What this meansBranson's flight — which came just nine days before Amazon bilionaire Jeff Bezos is slated to rocket into suborbital space aboard his own company's spacecraft —  is a landmark moment for the commercial space industry. The up-and-coming sector has for years been seeking to make suborbital space tourism (a relatively simple straight-up-and-down flight, as opposed to orbiting the Earth for longer periods) a viable business with the aim of allowing thousands of people to experience the adrenaline rush and sweeping views of our home planet that such flights can offer.Branson and Bezos are situated to become direct competitors in that industry, each offering tickets to wealthy customers for brief rides to the upper atmosphere aboard supersonic, rocket-powered spacecraft. Virgin Galactic plans to conduct just one more test flight before it will begin flying paying customers. More than 600 people have reserved tickets priced at $200,000 to $250,000 so far. The company is expected to reopen ticket sales soon, though at a higher price point.Branson's flight also helps bolster Virgin Galactic's reputation as the ""world's first commercial spaceline."" That's how the company advertised itself as it signed up those hundreds of willing customers who've waited through development delays — and a tragic mishap — for their chance to ride aboard SpaceShipTwo. But whether or not Virgin Galactic will really be the ""first"" commercially operational suborbital space company is not yet clear. Bezos' space company, Blue Origin, appeared poised to put its founder in space before Branson, until Virgin Galactic made the surprise announcement earlier this month that he would be on the very next test flight, a departure from the company's earlier plans. Bezos' flight, slated for July 20, could kick off the company's commercial operations sooner than that, and one of his fellow passengers on the flight is a paying customer, having won a ticket through a charity auction for the price of $28 million. The company has not yet begun selling tickets to the public, however, nor has it set a specific date for when it plans to do so.Neither company is expected to offer tickets that are affordable to the average American. Branson did tease a big ""announcement"" about his effort to ""democratize space"" ahead of the flight. But he revealed Sunday only that Virgin Galactic would be holding a ""sweepstakes"" for two free tickets, along with ",Richard Branson is the first person to ride into space aboard a space plane.

Anyone can read what you share.By Kenneth ChangSeeking to upstage Jeff Bezos as the first rocket company owner to go to space, Richard Branson, the British billionaire who founded a galaxy of Virgin companies, announced on Thursday night that he would be a member of the crew on the next test flight of the Virgin Galactic space plane.That flight is scheduled to take off on July 11 from Spaceport America in New Mexico.“The team was ready, so they asked Richard if he was ready to go,” said Aleanna Crane, vice president of communications for Virgin Galactic. “It’s a big day. It’s a very exciting day.”Mr. Branson will be in a position to claim bragging rights in a growing business of spaceflight for private citizens. Companies including Virgin Galactic and Mr. Bezos’s Blue Origin are competing to launch paying passengers on suborbital and orbital trips in the coming years. Although the first trips will be expensive, the expectation is that ticket prices will come down over time as the market grows.Mr. Branson founded Virgin Galactic in 2004 to provide short space tourist flights to the edge of space, and he has long said he will be a passenger on the first commercial flight. But development of the SpaceShipTwo — a winged rocket that flies to an altitude of more than 50 miles — has taken years longer than Mr. Branson expected. The setbacks included the crash of the first SpaceShipTwo plane, V.S.S. Enterprise, in October 2014 during a test flight, which killed one of the two pilots.In 2019, Virgin Galactic became a publicly traded company, although Mr. Branson’s Virgin Group remains the largest shareholder, with a 24 percent share.The most recent powered test flight, in May, was the first that the company conducted from New Mexico. Previously, development and testing of the spacecraft had occurred in Mojave, Calif.Ms. Crane said that the last flight had been so flawless that the team had decided to test the cabin experience. “Who better to test the full cabin experience than Richard Branson?” she said. “He is flying as a mission specialist, and he has a role like the rest of the crew.”The craft will carry three other Virgin Galactic employees in the cabin seats in addition to the two pilots up front.“It’s one thing to have a dream of making space more accessible to all,” Mr. Branson said in a statement. “It’s another for an incredible team to collectively turn that dream into reality.”The company plans to broadcast the flight beginning at 9 a.m. Eastern time on July 11. The SpaceShipTwo rocket, named Unity, will be carried under an airplane named White Knight Two to an altitude of 50,000 feet before being dropped. Unity’s engine will then ignite, taking it up to higher than 50 miles.At the top of the arc, passengers will float for about four minutes before the space plane re-enters the atmosphere and glides to a runway landing.If all goes as planned, Mr. Branson will make his flight nine days before Mr. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, straps into the New Shepard capsule built by his rocket company, Blue Origin. New Shepard has flown to the edge of space 15 times but has yet to carry any people. It is fully automated, without pilots.Billionaires like Mr. Branson, Mr. Bezos and Elon Musk are the vanguard in a new age of commercial spaceflight, accompanied by verbal jousting — sometimes playful, sometimes belittling — about whose company is better.On Wednesday, during an appearance on CNBC, Mr. Branson was asked if he was trying to beat Mr. Bezos to space. “Jeff who?” Mr. Branson replied with a straight face before laughing.The remark echoed one Mr. Musk had once made in a BBC interview.Even if Mr. Branson launches first, Mr. Bezos could still argue that he went to space and Mr. Branson did not. SpaceShipTwo does not quite reach the 62-mile altitude most often considered the edge of outer space, while New Shepard passes above that height, also known as the Karman line.“We wish him a great and safe flight, but they’re not flying above the Karman line and it’s a very different experience,” Bob Smith, Blue Origin’s chief executive, said in an emailed statement.However, the United States Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration put the boundary lower, at 50 miles. The F.A.A. granted astronaut wings to Virgin Galactic crew members who had flown on earlier test flights.Mr. Musk’s SpaceX builds rockets that are much larger than those currently flown by Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. While SpaceX is gearing up to fly private citizens on trips to orbit, including a flight scheduled for September, Mr. Musk has not yet announced when he might make a trip himself. But Blue Origin and SpaceX are in competition for federal contracts for projects including the launching of Department of Defense satellites and","The Virgin Galactic founder hopes to edge out, by nine days, Blue Origin's first flight with a crew aboard.

In 2004, he founded Virgin Galactic to provide adventurous tourists with rides on rocket-powered planes to the edge of space and back.At the time, he thought commercial service would begin in two to three years. Instead, close to 17 years have passed. Virgin Galactic says it still has three more test flights to conduct, including the one on Sunday, before it can be ready for paying passengers.Cars drove Mr. Branson and his crewmates to the plane on Sunday, and the flight took off on Sunday morning around 10:40 a.m. Eastern time from Spaceport America in New Mexico, about 180 miles south of Albuquerque. The space plane separated from the carrier ship around 11:25 a.m. and ignited its engine for about 60 seconds, carrying Mr. Branson and the crew into space. Video footage from the live stream showed him and the crew experiencing weightlessness.Minutes later, the plane began its return to Earth in a glide, and soon landed safely on the spaceport’s runway. Mr. Branson, speaking into a camera in the plane’s cabin during the glide, called it “an experience of a lifetime.”More than an hour later, a giddy Mr. Branson took a stage with his fellow crewmates.“The whole thing was magical,” he said.Chris Hadfield, the Canadian astronaut whose performance of David Bowie’s “Space Oddity” from the space station went viral some years ago, then pinned wings on the crewmates’ flight suits that officially designate them as astronauts.— Kenneth Chang The rocket plane, a type called SpaceShipTwo, is about the size of an executive jet. In addition to the two pilots, there can be up to four people in the cabin. The particular SpaceShipTwo that flew on Sunday is named V.S.S. Unity.To get off the ground, Unity was carried by a larger plane to an altitude of about 50,000 feet. There, Unity was released, and the rocket plane’s motor ignited. The acceleration made people on board feel a force up to 3.5 times their normal weight on the way to an altitude of more than 50 miles.At the top of the arc, those on board were able to see the blackness of space as well as the curve of Earth from the plane’s windows. They also got out of their seats and experienced about four minutes of apparent weightlessness. Fifty miles up, Earth’s downward gravitational pull is essentially just as strong as it is on the ground; rather, the passengers were falling at the same pace as the plane around them.The two tail booms at the back of the space plane then rotated up to a “feathered” configuration that created more drag and stability, allowing the plane to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere more gently. This configuration SpaceShipTwo like a badminton shuttlecock, which always falls with the pointy side oriented down, than a plane.Still, the forces felt by the passengers on the way down were greater than on the way up, reaching six times the force of gravity.Once the plane was back in the atmosphere, the tail booms rotated back down, and the plane glided to a landing. — Kenneth Chang Not long after Richard Branson re-entered Earth’s atmosphere on Sunday, he and other employees of his Virgin Galactic venture boasted that the company would greatly expand opportunities for the general public to travel to space. For the moment, those otherworldly views and feelings of weightlessness will still be held in rarefied air.A seat on one of the company’s spaceships originally cost $200,000. The company later raised the price to $250,000. It then stopped sales after a crash during a test flight in 2014. When the company resumes sales later this year, the price will probably rise again, said Michael Colglazier, Virgin Galactic’s chief executive.“We’re here to make space more accessible to all,” Mr. Branson said on Sunday as he was presented with his astronaut wings after his milestone flight.For a vast majority of Americans, the cost of such a trip is out of reach. In the future, Virgin Galactic and other spaceflight companies hope broadening opportunities to fly to space will bring down the cost of a ticket. But for now, primarily people with spare cash equivalent to the cost of some houses will be able to afford a few moments at the edge of space.Nevertheless, the company estimated on Sunday that more than 600 people from some 60 countries had signed up for one of its flights. The first paying SpaceShipTwo passengers may begin flying in the next year, after the company completes two more test flights.During Virgin Galactic’s livestream on Sunday, s",Virgin Galactic's Virgin Galactic space plane Unity lands safely in New Mexico.

Another billionaire with his own rocket company — Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon — has plans to make a similar jaunt to the edge of space in nine days.In each case, billionaire entrepreneurs are risking injury or death to fulfill their childhood aspirations — and advance the goal of making human spaceflight unexceptional.“They’re putting their money where their mouth is, and they’re putting their body where their money is,” said Eric Anderson, chairman of Space Adventures Limited, a company that charters launches to orbit. “That’s impressive, frankly.”At 8:40 a.m. Mountain time, a carrier aircraft, with the rocket plane, named V.S.S. Unity, tucked underneath, rose off the runway and headed to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. There, Unity was released, and a few moments later, its rocket motor ignited, accelerating the space plane on an upward arc.Although Unity had made three previous trips to space, this was its first launch that resembled a full commercial flight of the sort that Virgin Galactic has promised to offer the general public, with two pilots — David Mackay and Michael Masucci — and four more crew members including Mr. Branson.This flight resembled a party for Virgin Galactic and the nascent space tourism business. Guests included Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX; Michelle Lujan Grisham, the governor of New Mexico; and about 60 customers who have paid for future Virgin Galactic flights.Stephen Colbert of the CBS program “The Late Show” introduced segments of the webcast. After the landing, the R&B singer Khalid performed a new song.When the fuel was spent, Unity continued to coast upward to an altitude of 53.5 miles. The four people in back unbuckled and experienced about four minutes of floating before returning to their seats.Mr. Branson was accompanied in the cabin by Beth Moses, the company’s chief astronaut instructor; Colin Bennett, lead operations engineer; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research operations.Mr. Bennett said that he was busy with tasks during the first part of the flight and then he heard Ms. Moses shouting, “Don’t forget to look out the window.”He did. “It’s very Zen,” Mr. Bennett said of the view of Earth below. “What jumped out at me were the colors and just how far away it looked. It felt like we were just so far up there, and I was just mesmerized.”Ms. Bandla’s role was to evaluate another market Virgin Galactic is targeting: scientists doing research that takes advantage of minutes of microgravity. She conducted an experiment from the University of Florida which looked at how plants react to the changing conditions — particularly the swings in gravity — during the flight, part of research that could aid growing food on future long-duration space missions.As the space plane re-entered the atmosphere, the downward pull of gravity resumed.

With the flights made by Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson this month, the privatization of the space industry has crossed the point of no return.",https://t.co/1cP3bz3uO1?amp=1,"AdvertisementSupported byWith the suborbital flights made by Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson this month, the privatization of the space industry has crossed the point of no return.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By David Streitfeld and Erin WooThe anniversary of the Apollo moon landing marked one small step for space travel but a giant leap for space billionaires.Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson vividly demonstrated this month that soaring up to the near reaches of the sky appeared safe and, above all, a lark. The planet has so many problems that it is a relief to escape them even for 10 minutes, which was about the length of the suborbital rides offered by the entrepreneurs through their respective companies, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic.But beyond the dazzlement was a deeper message: The Amazonification of space has begun in earnest. What was once largely the domain of big government is now increasingly the realm of Big Tech. The people who sold you the internet will now sell you the moon and the stars.Mr. Bezos, the founder of Amazon and still its largest shareholder, made clear at the news conference after Tuesday’s flight that Blue Origin was open for business. Even though tickets were not generally available, sales for flights were already approaching $100 million. Mr. Bezos didn’t say what the price for each was but added, “The demand is very very high.”That demand was there even before the world’s media flocked to Van Horn, Texas, for extensive and adulatory coverage of Mr. Bezos doing something Mr. Branson had done in New Mexico the week before. They saw a carefully orchestrated event, with the world’s oldest-ever astronaut and the world’s youngest along for the ride, capped by a $200 million philanthropic giveaway.Even Elon Musk, chief executive of rival SpaceX and a sometimes skeptic of Mr. Bezos’ space dreams, felt compelled to offer his congratulations. So did Mr. Branson, who got bragging rights by making his flight first. Mr. Musk went to see Mr. Branson off.All of this space activity is the start of something new but also a replay of the 1990s. At the beginning of that decade, the internet was government property devoted to research and communication for a few. By the end, thanks to Mr. Bezos more than anyone, it was a place for everyone to buy things. Over the next 20 years, tech grew up and became Big Tech, provoking bipartisan fears that Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple are now too powerful.Outer space might now be embarked on a similar journey from frontier to big business.For decades, NASA did not get enough funding to do anything as epic as the Apollo program. The Trump administration decreed a return to the moon by 2024. The Biden administration has endorsed the goal but not the date. If it happens at all, it will be with the assistance of companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin. In contrast to the Apollo project in the 1960s, the next trip to the moon will be outsourced.Smaller space ventures are even more wide open to entrepreneurs.“If you look at where space is today, especially with respect to lower Earth orbit activities, it really is similar to the early days of the internet,” said West Griffin, chief financial officer of Axiom, a start-up aiming to build the first commercial space station.The commercialization of space began during the 1990s dot-com boom but took much longer to reach fruition. The flights this month hark back to 1996, when the nonprofit organization X Prize announced a contest: $10 million to the first nongovernmental organization to build a reusable spacecraft that could take someone to an altitude of 100 kilometers, or 62.5 miles, and then do it again in less than two weeks.The winning design in 2004 turned out to be SpaceShipOne in an effort led by Burt Rutan, an aerospace engineer who previously designed the Voyager airplane that flew around the world without stopping or refueling. It was financed by Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft who died in 2018.The X Prize piqued Mr. Branson’s interest, too. He trademarked “Virgin Galactic Airways” in 1999, and licensed the SpaceShipOne technology. Mr. Branson hoped that a larger version could begin commercial flights within three years. It took 17 years instead.A swelling ecosystem of start-ups is attempting to commercialize space by building everything from cheaper launch technology to smaller satellites to the infrastructure making up the “pickaxes and shovels” of space’s gold rush, as Meagan Crawford, a managing partner at the venture capital firm SpaceFund, puts it.“People are looking around going: ‘There’s this robust space industry. Where did that come from?’” Ms. Crawford said. “Well, it’s been built methodically and purposefully, and it’s been a lot of hard work over the last 30 years to get us here.”Investors poured $7 billion into funding space start-ups in 2020, double the amount from just two years prior, according to","With the suborbital flights made by Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, the privatization of the space industry has crossed the point of no return.",Amazonification of space would mean anyone could go. This is just another example of a bunch of tax cheats spending their money on frivolous stuff.,The US tax dollars we never saw going off to space to indulge other rich people who avoid paying taxes and that money will buy them a space ticket.

WP,richard branson space travel,1,Billionaires’ race to space: Virgin Galactic’s Richard Branson now says he’ll beat Blue Origin’s Bezos to space,https://t.co/1WlOvpd7hj?amp=1,"The billionaire space race is heating up.Richard Branson is set to get his long-awaited trip to space as early as July 11, flying on a suborbital mission that would allow him to beat Blue Origin’s Jeff Bezos, who is scheduled to fly on his company’s spacecraft nine days later.Branson had been scheduled to go on a later flight but is now set to be the first of the billionaire space entrepreneurs to blast out of the atmosphere.Wally Funk was supposed to go to space 60 years ago. Now she’s going with Jeff Bezos.In a statement announcing the mission, the company said Branson would be joined in the cabin by three Virgin Galactic employees who would evaluate the “cabin environment, seat comfort, the weightless experience, and the views of Earth that the spaceship delivers — all to ensure every moment of the astronaut’s journey maximizes the wonder and awe created by space travel.”Among those employees is Beth Moses, Virgin Galactic’s chief astronaut instructor, who flew to space on the company’s second spaceflight mission. Virgin Galactic’s plane, known as SpaceShipTwo Unity, has reached space on three occasions, and this would be the first time it will have flown a crew of four.In an interview, Branson said he was “incredibly excited” and that moving up his flight was “honestly not” intended to best Bezos.“I completely understand why the press would write that,” he said. “It’s just an incredible, wonderful coincidence that we’re going up in the same month.”Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, recently said he would fly on July 20, the anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. And on Thursday his space company, Blue Origin, announced he would be joined by Wally Funk, a member of the “Mercury 13,” a group of women privately tested and trained by a team of aviation medical experts for NASA’s astronaut program at the height of the space race.Both Branson’s and Bezos’s flights will travel on suborbital trajectories that will just scratch the edge of space and give passengers a few minutes of weightlessness. Wishing Branson well, Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith nevertheless sounded a note of one-upmanship in his reaction to Branson’s plans: “They’re not flying above the Kármán line, and it’s a very different experience.” The reference is to the different distances the two spacecraft are designed to travel. Blue Origin’s New Shepard capsule flies to an altitude of 100 kilometers or 62 miles, the so-called Kármán line, which some experts say is where space begins. Virgin Galactic’s spaceplane flies beyond 50 miles, above which the Federal Aviation Administration defines as space.Virgin Galactic recently received approval from the FAA that allows it to fly commercial passengers, paving the way for Branson to join the crew. In May, the company flew another test flight that went so well that the company felt it was safe to allow Branson to fly as part of the crew.“I’ve been itching to go, and they said they wanted somebody to properly test the astronaut experience,” he said in the interview. “And I was damned if I was going to let anyone take that seat.”Virgin Galactic, which Branson founded in 2004, has some 600 people signed up for flights — one of them Funk — and is expected to reopen sales around the time of Branson’s flight. The company had charged $250,000, but that price will increase. The company has not said what it would charge, but analysts have said it could be as much as $500,000.Blue Origin has not announced ticket prices either. But it recently auctioned off a seat for $28 million for its first spaceflight mission. The company has yet not announced who the winner is.Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos will fly to space at their own risk. Does that make it right for everyone?Virgin Galactic flies out of Spaceport America in New Mexico. Unlike a traditional rocket, Virgin’s spacecraft is carried aloft to some 45,000 feet by a mother plane. The spacecraft is then dropped, and the pilots ignite its engines and fly the craft almost straight up.In addition to Branson and Moses, Sirisha Bandla, Virgin Galactic’s vice president of government affairs and research operations, and Colin Bennett, the company’s lead operations engineer, would join the flight.Virgin Galactic’s CEO, Michael Colglazier, said in an interview that the crew “are going to open the door for the rest of us to find a way to access space in the future.”He said the company did a thorough safety review and determined that the previous test flight met all its objectives, meaning the company could move Branson up to its next test flight instead of the one to follow.“It really gave us a choice as to whether Richard would prefer to fly on the first or the second,” Colglazier said. “And guess which one he chose?”Branson said that after waiting to go to space for 17 years, he was most looking forward to seeing Earth from a distance, and allowing his customers, some of whom have been waiting for years, to go as well.“I truly believe that space belongs to all of us,” ",Richard Branson is set to get his long-awaited trip to space as early as July 11.

Instead of a stoic countdown, there was a party-like atmosphere along the tarmac, a scene as much a spectacle as a space launch that even included a musical guest, Khalid, who debuted a new song during a performance here. The company’s live broadcast of the flight was hosted by comedian and late-night host Stephen Colbert, and Musk was on hand to watch Branson and the crew take off.Unlike traditional rockets that launch vertically, Virgin’s SpaceShipTwo Unity takes off tethered to the belly of a mother ship. On Sunday, the mother ship, known as WhiteKnightTwo, lifted off from the tarmac here shortly after 10:30 a.m. Eastern time, delayed by about 90 minutes because high winds overnight had kept the ground crew from rolling it out of the hangar. The spaceship was released at about 11:25 a.m. Eastern time, the pilots ignited the engine and the spacecraft shot almost straight up as it thundered toward space.The flight reached its apogee at 282,000 feet — 53.41 miles — where the passengers were able to unstrap and experience weightlessness. The spacecraft then fell back to earth and a landing at 11:39 Eastern time.Virgin Galactic’s quest for spaceOn board were pilots Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci, both of whom had flown to space on previous flights. Joining Branson in the crew compartment were Sirisha Bandla, Virgin Galactic’s vice president of government affairs, Colin Bennett, the company’s lead operations engineer, and Beth Moses, its chief astronaut instructor. Moses, who is married to Mike Moses, the company’s president, flew on Virgin Galactic’s second spaceflight mission, in 2019.Branson had originally been scheduled to fly aboard a flight scheduled for later this summer or early fall. But after the company successfully made it to space in May, he grew impatient.“I’ve been itching to go, and they said they wanted somebody to properly test the astronaut experience,” Branson said in a recent interview with The Post. “And I was damned if I was going to let anyone take that seat.”In a press conference after the flight, he said he wasn’t ner",Virgin Galactic says it will soon start flying paying paying customers regularly on similar jaunts.

Bezos, who founded Blue Origin in 2000, said this first crewed space flight was a step toward developing a fleet of reusable spacecraft.

The trip took approximately 10 minutes.  If you're just reading in, here's what you need to know about the flight — and what comes next for the company:  The billionaire space race: Jeff Bezos was not the first billionaire to space to fly on a craft he helped fund — thanks to Richard Branson and his company, Virgin Galactic, which rocketed into space only nine days prior. Bezos is, however, now the richest person to go to space. Not to mention, Bezos' rocket ship flew farther into space than Branson's, reaching 62 miles above Earth — otherwise known as the Kármán line. In comparison, Branson's crew flew roughly 50 miles above Earth. The crew: In addition to the Amazon founder, New Shepard was crewed by Jeff Bezos' brother, Mark Bezos, pilot Wally Funk and 18-year-old Oliver Daemen. At 82 years old, Funk is the oldest person to go to space — and she she had decades of piloting experience under her belt. Funk volunteered as a member of the Mercury 13 program, otherwise known as the """"Women in Space Program,"""" in February 1961, which was a privately-funded effort intended to begin training women to fly in NASA's earliest space programs. However, Funk was denied her chance to go to space until today. At 18 years old, Daemen is the youngest person to go to space, according to Blue Origin. A recent high school graduate, Daemen was Blue Origin's first paying customer, after his father, an investor, purchased his ticket. The flight: Despite a couple of brief delays, the New Shepard launched into space smoothly. The rocket fired into space, the engine kicked off, the crew capsule separated from the rocket and the booster successfully landed on the ground pad. More than 60 miles above Earth, the passengers experienced about three minutes of weightlessness, unstrapping from their seats and floating about the cabin while taking in panoramic views. Then, the crew capsule returned to Earth and made its landing, kicking up a large cloud of desert dust.  The celebrations: Upon landing successfully, the crew popped a bottle of champagne, and Jeff Bezos called it the """"best day ever."""" Later, during a press conference, each passenger aboard the New Shepard rocket was presented with Blue Origin's wings to commemorate their trip. The future: Blue Origin says efforts such as today's trip to space will allow the company to provide a future where people can live and work in space in order to keep the planet clean. """"Blue Origin is working on this today by developing partially and fully reusable launch vehicles that are safe, low cost, and serve the needs of all civil, commercial and defense customers,"""" the company said. However, Blue Origin will continue to explore space tourism by offering tickets for joyrides to high-paying customers. In fact, the company announced it is open for ticket sales today. Those interested in flying on a future Blue Origin flight were asked to send the company an email — but we still don't know how much a ticket will cost. Nevertheless, Jeff Bezos said his space company is approaching $100 million in private sales.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos successfully flew to space this morning.

The mission will be a short suborbital flight, with the rocket rising above the 62-mile threshold generally regarded as the beginning of space, before returning to Earth.Passengers aboard the rocket, called New Shepard, will experience zero gravity for four minutes and then touch back down in the desert in West Texas, the site of the rocket’s launch.Ms. Funk, who goes by Wally, was one of 13 American women who went through a rigorous astronaut-training program in the 1960s to determine whether women were fit for space. Despite testing just as well as men at the time, none ever became astronauts: The program was privately funded and not recognized by NASA. More important, NASA was accepting only trained fighter-jet pilots — a job open only to men — as candidates to become astronauts at that time, according to History.com. It wasn’t until 1983, five years after the fighter-pilot requirement was lifted, that the United States sent its first woman, Sally Ride, into space.“They told me that I had done better and completed the work faster than any of the guys,” Ms. Funk said in a video posted to Mr. Bezos’ Instagram account. But each of the four times she told NASA she wanted to become an astronaut, she was denied.“They said, ‘Well, you’re a girl, you can’t do that,’” she recalled in the video. “I said: ‘Guess what? Doesn’t matter what you are, you can still do it if you want to do it.’ And I like to do things that nobody’s ever done.”Through a spokeswoman, Blue Origin declined to arrange an interview with Ms. Funk on Thursday.Ms. Funk was the first female Federal Aviation Administration inspector and first female National Transportation Safety Board air safety investigator. And with the New Shepard flight later this month, she will blaze yet another trail, becoming the oldest person to fly into space.“No one has waited longer,” Mr. Bezos wrote in an Instagram caption. “It’s time. Welcome to the crew, Wally.

Oliver Daemen takes the spot of another passenger who paid $28 million for the seat but had a scheduling conflict.,https://t.co/SPvWMEGdH0?amp=1,"AdvertisementSupported byOliver Daemen will fly to the edge of space after another passenger who paid $28 million for the seat had a scheduling conflict.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Kenneth ChangSomeone paid $28 million to not go to space with Jeff Bezos next week. Instead, an 18-year-old from the Netherlands will join the flight.His name is Oliver Daemen, and the flight would make him the youngest person ever to go to space.Mr. Bezos, who just stepped down as chief executive of Amazon, announced last month that he would be one of the passengers when his rocket company, Blue Origin, conducts its first human spaceflight. The flight is scheduled for Tuesday, to coincide with the 52nd anniversary of the landing of Apollo 11 on the moon. It is to follow Richard Branson’s flight to the edge of space this past Sunday in a rocket plane built for the company he founded, Virgin Galactic.When Mr. Bezos made the announcement, he said one of the other seats on New Shepard, a reusable suborbital capsule that goes up more than 62 miles before coming back down, would be auctioned to the highest bidder, with the proceeds going to Mr. Bezos’ space-focused charity, Club for the Future.More than 7,600 people from 159 countries participated in the monthlong auction, which concluded on June 12. The winning bid was $28 million, and Blue Origin said it would reveal the bidder at a later date.On Thursday, just five days before the flight, Blue Origin still did not reveal the winning bidder, but said in a news release that this person decided to defer the trip to a future New Shepard launch “due to scheduling conflicts.”Instead, Mr. Daemen, the son of the chief executive of a private equity investment firm and one of the runners-up in the auction, will take the seat.“He was a participant in the auction and had secured a seat on the second flight,” Sara Blask, a Blue Origin spokeswoman, said in an email. “We moved him up when this seat on the first flight became available.”Mr. Daemen graduated from high school last year and is taking a year off from school before starting in the fall at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.“This is a dream come true!” Mr. Daemen said in a news release from the family. “I hadn’t counted on this at all until last week that surprising phone call from Blue Origin came. This is so unbelievably cool! The flight to and into space only takes 10 minutes, but I already know that these will be the most special 10 minutes of my life.”Blue Origin’s spacecraft, New Shepard, is designed for brief space-tourist flights, similar to Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo. But, unlike Virgin Galactic’s space plane design, New Shepard is more of a traditional rocket that launches vertically. Near the top of the arc, the capsule, where up to six people sit, separates from the booster. The booster and the capsule coast to an altitude above 62 miles, regarded by many as the boundary of outer space. The capsule’s landing is slowed by a parachute.On this first flight, there will be four people aboard: Mr. Daemen; Mr. Bezos; Mr. Bezos’ brother, Mark; and Mary Wallace Funk, a pilot who in the 1960s was among a group of women who passed the same rigorous criteria that NASA used for selecting astronauts. But that was at a time when the space agency had no interest in selecting women as astronauts.At 18, Mr. Daemen will be the youngest person ever to go to space. At 82, Ms. Funk, who goes by Wally, will be the oldest.According to the family’s news release, Mr. Daemen and his father, Joes Daemen, founder of Somerset Capital Partners in the Netherlands, were intrigued by the possibility of getting on the flight. “But when the bids started to skyrocket during the auction, we dropped out,” Joes Daemen said.Blue Origin did not reveal how much the Daemens were paying for the seat; it has not yet publicly announced a price for tickets. According to the Daemens, the price is a lot lower than the $28 million winning bid. The money they paid will be donated by Blue Origin to a charity that has not yet been determined.On Wednesday, Blue Origin announced that $19 million from the $28 million winning bid will go to 19 space-related nonprofit organizations — $1 million each. The recipients include AstraFemina, a collective of women in science and engineering who aim to serve as role models to girls; the Brook Owens Fellowship, which offers paid internships and fellowships to undergraduate women; and Higher Orbits, an experimental learning lab for high school students.Kitty Bennett contributed research and Claire Moses contributed translation.Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that's out of this world.Advertisement",Oliver Daemen will fly to the edge of space after another passenger who paid $28 million for the seat had a scheduling conflict.

All of you.” [cheering] “Welcome back, astronauts.”By Kenneth ChangJeff Bezos, the richest human in the world, went to space on Tuesday. It was a brief jaunt — rising 60-some miles into the sky above West Texas — in a spacecraft that was built by Mr. Bezos’ rocket company, Blue Origin.The flight, even though it did not enter orbit, was a milestone for the company that Mr. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, started more than 20 years ago, the first time a Blue Origin vehicle carried people to space.“Best day ever,” Mr. Bezos exclaimed once the capsule had settled in the dust near the launch site.That Mr. Bezos himself was seated in the capsule reflects his enthusiasm for the endeavor and perhaps signals his intent to give Blue Origin the focus and creative entrepreneurship that made Amazon one of the most powerful economic forces on the planet.Outside of short delays in the countdown, the launch proceeded smoothly.Just after 8:30 a.m. Eastern time, the four passengers arrived at a bridge atop the launch platform, with each ringing a bell hung at one end before crossing to the capsule.

All of you.” [cheering] “Welcome back, astronauts.”By Kenneth ChangVAN HORN, Texas — Jeff Bezos, the richest human in the world, went to space on Tuesday. It was a brief jaunt — rising more than 65 miles into the sky above West Texas — in a spacecraft that was built by Mr. Bezos’ rocket company, Blue Origin.While Mr. Bezos was beaten to space last week by Richard Branson, the British entrepreneur who flew in a rocket plane from his company Virgin Galactic, some analysts consider Blue Origin, founded by Mr. Bezos more than 20 years ago, to be a more significant contender in the future space economy. The company has ambitions of a scale far beyond short flights for space tourists, and it is backed by the entrepreneur who made Amazon into an economic powerhouse.Lori Garver, who served as deputy administrator of NASA during the Obama administration, said that Mr. Bezos “has a huge, long-term vision that is multigenerational.” She added that his intent for Blue Origin was to “compete for even higher stakes” in the growing business of space.In 2017, Mr. Bezos announced that he would sell $1 billion of Amazon stock a year to fund the space venture, and Blue Origin has already pursued a range of business opportunities, such as trying to win contracts for a moon lander for NASA astronauts as well as launching satellites for the Department of Defense on large reusable rockets.In recent years before he stepped down as chief executive of Amazon, Mr. Bezos would typically spend a day a week — usually Wednesdays — focused on Blue Origin. That Mr. Bezos himself was seated in the capsule for Tuesday’s space trip makes plain that he is putting spaceflight at the top of his spending list.“The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel,” he said a few years ago, couching his investment as a form of philanthropy.Mr. Bezos has described a vision of humanity’s future that is influenced by the proposals of Gerard K. O’Neill, a Princeton physicist. In the 1970s, Dr. O’Neill proposed giant cylinder-shape space colonies that in great enough numbers would support far more people and industry than are possible on Earth.“The solar system can easily support a trillion humans,” Mr. Bezos said. “If we had a trillion humans, we would have a thousand Einsteins and a thousand Mozarts and unlimited, for all practical purposes, resources and solar power.”By contrast, Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, has focused on the idea of settling Mars. Getting to Mars is an easier task than building one of O’Neill’s colonies, but making cold and airless Mars hospitable to human civilization would be an enormous undertaking.And despite Tuesday’s successful flight, Blue Origin has much progress to make. To have the impact on humanity’s future that Mr. Bezos describes, Blue Origin will need much more than the small New Shepard vehicle that Mr. Bezos and three other passengers flew to the edge of space on Tuesday.Although private enterprise has always worked with governments on space travel, it is only in recent decades that private companies have started seeking to make business opportunities from tourist spaceflight.Blue Origin’s accomplishments pale next to the rocket company led by another of the world’s richest people: SpaceX, which Mr. Musk founded a couple of years after Blue Origin started.SpaceX is already a behemoth in the space business. It regularly takes NASA astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, it has already deployed more than 1,500 satellites in its Starlink constellation to provide internet service everywhere, and it is developing a gargantuan rocket called Starship for missions for Mars and elsewhere.By contrast, Blue Origin’s forthcoming projects, at least in the near future, do not seem poised to upend the space industry the way SpaceX has.The larger reusable rocket for launching satellites that Mr. Bezos’ company is working on, New Glenn, is still more than a year away, and efforts to win major government contracts like launching Department of Defense satellites have so far come up empty.

WP,jeff bezos space travel,1,Wally Funk was supposed to go space 60 years ago. Now she’s going with Jeff Bezos.,https://t.co/2kaGNEph1Q?amp=1,"By most accounts, Wally Funk should have been to space by now.In 1961, Funk was the youngest member of the “Mercury 13,” a group of 13 women privately tested and trained by a team of aviation medical experts for NASA’s astronaut program at the height of the space race. But the program, which put the women through the same rigorous testing as the Mercury 7, NASA’s all-male team of original astronauts, was canceled.Sixty years later, Funk, 82, is poised to become the oldest person to reach space. Jeff Bezos announced in an Instagram post Thursday that Funk would be joining him, his brother, Mark, and the unnamed winner of an auction aboard Blue Origin’s first crewed spaceflight on July 20, the anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969.A seat to fly with Jeff Bezos to space sells at auction for $28 millionFunk is a pioneer in aviation: She was the first female Federal Aviation Administration inspector and first female National Transportation Safety Board air safety investigator. She has logged 19,600 hours of flight time and taught more than 3,000 people to fly, she said in Bezos’s Instagram video.“Everything that the FAA has, I’ve got the license for,” Funk says in the video. “And, I can outrun you!”A post shared by Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos)In the Instagram video, Bezos describes the plan for the New Shepard’s journey to a wide-eyed Funk, down to the moment when the rocket returns to the desert surface and its doors open.“We open the hatch, and you step outside. What’s the first thing you say?” Bezos asks Funk. She does not hesitate.Jeff Bezos announces he’ll be on first crewed spaceflight of Blue Origin rocket“I will say, ‘Honey, that’s the best thing that ever happened to me!’ ” Funk declares, pulling Bezos into a bear hug.Funk is Bezos’s “honored guest” on the flight, which will also be joined by the winner of Blue Origin’s auction for his company’s nonprofit foundation. Nearly 7,600 bidders from 159 countries participated in the auction, which topped out at $28 million. (Bezos, the founder of Amazon, owns The Washington Post).Blue Origin has said travelers must be able to endure three times the force of gravity for two minutes on ascent and 5½ times the force of gravity for a few seconds on the way down. Participants must be between 5 feet and 6-feet-4-inches tall and weigh between 110 and 223 pounds. As a young girl, Funk used to jump off the roof of her parents’ barn in a Superman cape, pretending to fly. She loved to build model planes and ships, became an “expert marksman” at 14 and skied competitively for the United States in slalom and downhill races. She has been flying since 1957. She is also an antique car enthusiast and “avid zipliner,” according to her website.When NASA finally opened its programs to women in 1976, Funk applied four times and received four rejections. But she has never been the type to let anything stand in her way, she says in the video.“I like to do things that nobody has ever done,” Funk said.The July 20 flight would have made Bezos the first of the billionaire “space barons” to go to space, a significant milestone for him and Blue Origin, which lags behind Elon Musk’s SpaceX in the competition for billions of dollars in NASA and Pentagon contracts and which flies a more powerful rocket capable of taking people and supplies into orbit. But hours after the announcement that Funk would be on the flight, Virgin Galactic’s Richard Branson, who will turn 71 July 18, announced that he plans to be aboard his company’s space plane on its next test flight, now scheduled for July 11. That would place him in space ahead of Bezos.Bezos has long been fascinated with space. An avid science fiction reader and big “Star Trek” fan as a child, he has called watching the Apollo 11 moon landing a seminal moment for him, even though he was just 5 years old at the time. He chose “Goddard” as the middle name for one of his sons in homage to Robert Goddard, the founder of modern rocketry.The New Shepard is named for Alan Shepard, who became the first American to go to space in 1961. Like that first suborbital flight, New Shepard shoots straight up, flying past 60 miles to reach the edge of space before falling back to Earth. The flight takes about 10 minutes in all, with a few minutes of weightlessness in space.Neither Musk nor Virgin Galactic’s Richard Branson have ridden on their companies’ rockets, though there is speculation Branson may be trying to beat Bezos with a secretive launch in the coming weeks. In late June, Virgin Galactic won FAA approval to take customers to space, making it the first spaceline to cross that hurdle.In 2010, Funk put down $200,000 for a future Virgin Galactic flight. She has spent years waiting and visiting Spaceport America, anticipating what she thought would be her first trip to space. But by the time she gets to cash in that ticket, she will already be an astronaut.Christian Davenport contributed to this report.The latest: Rock","Jeff Bezos announced in an Instagram post that he'll be aboard Blue Origin's first crewed spaceflight on July 20.

WP,jeff bezos space travel,2,"Blue Origin announced Thursday that 18-year-old Oliver Daemen, of the Netherlands, would fly to space with founder Jeff Bezos aboard the company’s first human spaceflight after the winner of a $28 million auction postponed.",https://t.co/yO1ycoDrxe?amp=1,"Blue Origin announced Thursday that 18-year-old Oliver Daemen of the Netherlands will be joining founder Jeff Bezos on the company’s first crewed spaceflight after the winner of a $28 million auction postponed.Blue Origin said the auction winner, who has asked to remain anonymous, would fly “on a future mission due to scheduling conflicts.” A company spokesman said Daemen, an incoming physics and innovation management student at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, had participated in the auction and “secured a seat on the second flight. We moved him up when this seat on the first flight became available.”The company would not say how much the bid was. His father is Joes Daemen, the founder and chief executive of Somerset Capital Partners, which invests in real estate, private equity and financial markets.The flight is scheduled for Tuesday from the company’s launch site in West Texas.Daemen will travel with Bezos (who also founded Amazon and owns The Washington Post), his brother Mark Bezos and Wally Funk, an 82-year-old aviator and member of the Mercury 13 — a group of women who had been privately trained for NASA’s astronaut program at the height of the space race. Though they were put through the same rigorous testing as the Mercury 7, the women, unlike the men, never got the chance to fly.Daemen would become Blue Origin’s first paying customer and the youngest person ever to fly to space.“At 18-years-old and 82-years-young, Oliver Daemen and Wally Funk represent the youngest and oldest astronauts to travel to space,” Blue Origin said in a statement.Blue Origin described Daemen as a lifelong space enthusiast and said he took a gap year after graduating from high school in 2020 to obtain his private pilot’s license. On his LinkedIn page, Daemen lists NASA, Boeing, Tesla and Blue Origin as interests.The $28 million paid by the unnamed auction winner is extraordinarily high for a suborbital flight that lasts roughly 10 minutes and affords just three or four minutes in space. Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic had been charging $250,000 for similar flights. And Houston-based Axiom Space has sold week-long trips to the International Space Station for $55 million.Blue Origin has said auction proceeds would go to its nonprofit, Club for the Future, which promotes careers in science, technology, math and engineering. On Wednesday, it announced it was awarding $1 million grants to 19 nonprofits, including the National Space Society, Space Camp, the Planetary Society and Students for the Exploration and Development of Space, a college group that Bezos was part of while an undergraduate at Princeton University.Blue Origin said 7,600 bidders from 159 countries took part in the auction.The flight is scheduled to coincide with the July 20 anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969.“This marks the beginning of commercial operations for New Shepard, and Oliver represents a new generation of people who will help us build a road to space,” Bob Smith, Blue Origin’s CEO, said in a statement, referring to the rocket system that will carry the passengers.Alice Crites contributed to this report.The latest: Rockets aren’t enough.

In addition to Bezos, on board the capsule were Bezos’s brother, Mark; Wally Funk, an 82-year-old aviation pioneer, and Oliver Daemen, an 18-year-old student from the Netherlands who lucked into the flight when the winner of an auction for the fourth seat had to postpone.

But for Blue Origin, which Bezos founded in 2000, it marked a significant milestone — the company’s first human spaceflight — and a statement that it was staking a claim in a modern space race that has been dominated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX.Last month, Bezos, 57, announced he would be on the flight, a move that surprised few who know Bezos’s passion for space.

WP,jeff bezos space travel,5,Late-night hosts mock Jeff Bezos’s space “joyride”: He celebrated “like it was the end of a yacht race”,https://t.co/2BY1RpEFtw?amp=1,"For Stephen Colbert, the copious news coverage of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s “joyride into the ionosphere” took the billionaire turned astronaut’s 10-minute space shuttle flight a bit too seriously.“When they landed, the ‘billion-nauts’ sprayed each other with champagne like it was the end of a yacht race,” Colbert said during the opening monologue of “The Late Show” on Tuesday. “If something is really important, it doesn’t need a big wet celebration. You’ll remember Buzz Aldrin didn’t douse Neil Armstrong with Gatorade.”Jokes about the brief foray into space inside a ship called the New Shepard dominated the late-night shows on Tuesday as comedians lampooned the rocket’s phallic appearance and mocked Bezos for his post-flight persona.Bezos launched into space Tuesday morning from a spaceport in the West Texas desert for a short flight with a crew of three other people, including his brother, Mark Bezos; 82-year-old Wally Funk, who became the oldest astronaut to enter space; and 18-year-old Oliver Daemen, a student from the Netherlands who bought his seat in an auction. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)Jeff Bezos, Mark Bezos, Wally Funk and Oliver Daemen reach space, return safely on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocketAfter the crew landed safely, Bezos drew some ire from critics when he thanked the Amazon employees and customers who have built his immense wealth: “I want to thank every Amazon employee and every Amazon customer because you guys paid for all of this,” he said.Colbert rolled that clip on his show Tuesday night and then quipped: “It’s funny because he doesn’t pay taxes or his employees.”Amazon, where Bezos still serves as executive chairman, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Bezos’s attempt to credit the people who have contributed to his fortune fell flat for some critics in part because of long-standing complaints about working conditions inside Amazon warehouses and recent reports that the multibillionaire has at times avoided paying federal taxes. Last month, ProPublica reported that, despite being one of the wealthiest people in the world, Bezos had not paid a penny in federal income taxes in 2007 or 2011, according to a trove of Internal Revenue Service records.Late-night comedians were hardly alone in challenging Bezos over his decision to spend his money on space travel.“Listen, I’m all for space exploration and it must have been an amazing view,” Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) tweeted Tuesday. “But maybe — and I’m just spitballing here — if Amazon and other companies paid their fair share in taxes, we could lift all kids — if not into space — at least out of poverty.”Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) also lashed out, saying Amazon workers paid for the rocket “with lower wages, union busting, a frenzied and inhumane workplace, and delivery drivers not having health insurance during a pandemic.”On Tuesday, Bezos boasted about bringing a pair of goggles that had belonged to Amelia Earhart on the space flight. The billionaire claimed Earhart had worn the antique protective eyewear on her flight around the world that ended when she crash-landed and vanished in 1937.“That’s an interesting choice for a good-luck charm,” Colbert said on “The Late Show.” “Okay, we’ve got Amelia Earhart’s goggles, we have a chunk of the iceberg from the Titanic, and in here we’ve got Abraham Lincoln’s playbill. Let’s go.”So, uhh, about Jeff Bezos’s cowboy hat …Of course, the true star of the night was the cowboy hat Bezos wore as he emerged from the rocket once it had landed safely on Earth.“You know you’re rich when you put that on and everyone who works for you goes, ‘Oh, it looks great.

Its shutdown would have serious impacts on our weather.,https://t.co/RGlhzRmH4S,"By Angela Dewan, CNNUpdated 9:43 AM ET, Fri August 6, 2021  (CNN)A crucial system of currents in the Atlantic Ocean that helps control temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere and has implications for the entire planet's weather systems is showing signs of instability due to human-made climate change, scientists say. Its collapse would have dire consequences for our weather and life on Earth.The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) -- which the Gulf Stream is a major part of -- helps maintain the energy balance in the Atlantic Ocean. It is often described as a ""conveyor belt"" that takes warm surface water from the tropics and distributes it to the north Atlantic. The colder, saltier water then sinks and flows south.A study, published Thursday in Nature and Climate Change, warned of ""an almost complete loss of stability of the AMOC over the course of the last century. Researchers say it could be close to a collapse from a strong circulation to a weak circulation, though the threshold for such a collapse is still uncertain.Scientists have warned for years that the circulation is weakening. Heavy rain and melting ice sheets are making the water in the North Atlantic Ocean less salty, which makes it lighter and less likely to sink. If the water in this region becomes too light, the entire circulation could be disrupted.Global weather patterns are critically linked to the circulation and its transport of heat and nutrients around the planet. A collapse of this system would result in significant and abrupt changes, including fast sea level rise, more extreme winters in Western Europe and disruptions to monsoon systems in the tropics. It could also have a cascading effect and destabilize other components of the Earth's climate system, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the Amazon rainforest.This scenario was the premise for the 2004 climate science fiction film ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" in which a series of extreme weather disaster",Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a crucial part of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.,Do republicans believe that oceans exist?,The sky!

With significant advances in computing power, scientists are more confident than ever in attributing extreme weather to climate change.In June, an unprecedented heat wave in the Pacific Northwest killed hundreds of people and shattered records in Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Canada logged a new national record high when a town in British Columbia soared to 121.3 degrees Fahrenheit.Historic heat waves are so clearly caused by human-driven emissions that researchers can now easily link them to climate change. Scientists at World Weather Attribution concluded this summerâs Northwest heat wave would have been âvirtually impossibleâ without it.Around the globe, human greenhouse gas emissions have already triggered more intense and more frequent hot-weather extremes, according to the report.Some extreme weather will happen more often even at 1.5 degrees, which the world can avoid only with very low future greenhouse gas emissions. If warming exceeds that benchmark, extreme heat events will become more intense and more frequent.As the global temperature rises, the chance of experiencing a 50-year-event increases from 2 percent per year to nearly 80 percent per year. A 50-year-event is when the temperature exceeds a level seen only once during the 50-year baseline period from 1850-1900.Source: IPCC AR6 Working Group I reportJust a",Human greenhouse gas emissions have already triggered more intense and more frequent hot-weather extremes.

At around 1,067 feet above sea level and 35% full, the Colorado River reservoir is at its lowest since the lake was filled after the Hoover Dam was completed in the 1930s. Lake Powell, which is also fed by the Colorado River and is the country's second-largest reservoir,  recently sank to a record low and is now 32% full. ""It's very significant,"" Brad Udall, senior water and climate scientist at Colorado State University, told CNN. ""It's something that those of us in the climate community have been worried about for over a decade, based on declining flows due to climate change.""With the lake expected to remain at around 1,066 feet of elevation into 2022, according to the US Bureau of Reclamation's latest monthly projections, the agency announced that the Colorado River will go into the first tier of water cuts beginning January 1.""Given ongoing historic drought and low runoff conditions in the Colorado River Basin, downstream releases from Glen Canyon Dam and Hoover Dam will be reduced in 2022 due to declining reservoir levels,"" the report said.Lake Mead provides water to roughly 25 million people in Arizona, Nevada, California and Mexico, according to the National Park Service.

Ida checked all the boxes",https://t.co/Ec1v8bgB68,"By Rachel Ramirez, CNNUpdated 7:56 PM ET, Mon August 30, 2021  (CNN)Human-caused climate change is making hurricanes more dangerous. They are producing more rainfall, moving slower once they make landfall and generating larger storm surges along the coast. Hurricane Ida was a prime example of those changes, and scientists say storms like this will become more common as the planet warms. CNN's Brandon Miller contributed to this report.Fueled by warmer-than-normal water in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Ida destroyed homes, uprooted trees and cut off power to more than 1 million residents. It battered Mississippi and the already storm-ravaged state of Louisiana, and officials there say they expect the death toll to increase in the coming days.Hurricane Ida was just the latest in back-to-back storms that have slammed Louisiana in recent years. But Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy and professor at Texas Tech University, said an important distinction is not the frequency of the storms but their severity.""We've always had hurricanes, we've always had heat waves, we've always had floods and droughts, but what climate change is doing is loading the weather dice against us,"" Hayhoe told CNN.

Within two weeks, two storms -- Henri and Ida -- broke rainfall records in the Northeast. Flash flood emergencies from the remnants of Hurricane Ida stretched for 190 miles from Philadelphia to New York City. Central Park recorded its wettest hour on record, while Newark, New Jersey, recorded its wettest day. As of Friday, the floods had killed at least 46 people in the region.

Yet the sequoia's footprint is shrinking, as human-induced climate change threatens this ancient tree's survival.Sequoias were once found across the Northern Hemisphere, but today, they only naturally grow across the western slopes of the southern Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.So when the Castle Fire broke out in August 2020, and merged with another fire to tear through more than 174,000 acres over four months, the loss was something even experts didn't think possible -- somewhere between 7,500 to 10,600 mature giant sequoias were destroyed, according to a report by the National Park Service, published in June.That's 10-14% of the entire world's population of mature sequoias -- a big chunk of history up in flames.

Colombia was the worst-affected country, the group said, with 65 defenders killed for either protecting Indigenous land or defending forests and their coca crops. Mexico, where a third of the attacks were linked to deforestation, ranked second with 30 killings. The Philippines was the only country outside the region to record more than 15 deaths, Global Witness reported — 29 people there were killed for attempting to halt mining, logging, and dam projects. Together, the more than half of the attacks in 2020 took place in those three countries, according to Global Witness.The family members of some victims described to Global Witness how lockdowns during the pandemic made it easier for defenders to be attacked in their own homes, targeted for taking on governments and businesses to protect natural resources that their communities rely on. The climate crisis is stretching natural resources thin. Scientists said in August that the planet is warming much faster than previously thought.

But under current emissions commitments from countries there will be a 16% increase in emissions in 2030 compared to 2010 levels, according to the report.That would lead the planet to warm to 2.7 degrees above pre-industrial levels, the report says.Scientists have said global temperatures should remain below 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels to stave off the worse consequences of the climate crisis. A UN report in August showed global temperature is already around 1.2 degrees of warming.In a statement about today's report, UN Secretary-General António Guterres called the planet's current path ""catastrophic.""""This is breaking the promise made six years ago to pursue the 1.5-degree Celsius goal of the Paris Agreement,"" Guterres said.

Researchers who study ancient climate change have also uncovered evidence that the AMOC can turn off abruptly, causing wild temperature swings and other dramatic shifts in global weather systems.Sign up for the latest news about climate change, energy and the environment, delivered every ThursdayScientists haven’t directly observed the AMOC slowing down. But the new analysis, published Thursday in the journal Nature Climate Change, draws on more than a century of ocean temperature and salinity data to show significant changes in eight indirect measures of the circulation’s strength.These indicators suggest that the AMOC is running out of steam, making it more susceptible to disruptions that might knock it out of equilibrium, said study author Niklas Boers, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.If the circulation shuts down, it could bring extreme cold to Europe and parts of North America, raise sea levels along the U.S. East Coast and disrupt seasonal monsoons that provide water to much of the world.“This is an increase in understanding … of how close to a tipping point the AMOC might already be,” said Levke Caesar, a climate physicist at Maynooth University who was not involved in the study.Boers’s analysis doesn’t suggest exactly when the switch might happen.

WP,climate change,2,"Humans have pushed the climate into ‘unprecedented’ territory, landmark U.N. report finds",https://t.co/PQ8kGfil8w,"More than three decades ago, a collection of scientists assembled by the United Nations first warned that humans were fueling a dangerous greenhouse effect and that if the world did not act collectively and deliberately to slow Earth’s warming, there could be “profound consequences” for people and nature alike.The scientists were right.On Monday, that same body — the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — described how humans have altered the environment at an “unprecedented” pace and detailed how catastrophic impacts lie ahead unless the world rapidly and dramatically cuts greenhouse gas emissions.The landmark report states that there is no remaining scientific doubt that humans are fueling climate change. That much is “unequivocal.” The only real uncertainty that remains, its authors say, is whether the world can muster the will to stave off a darker future than the one it already has carved in stone.The sprawling assessment, compiled by 234 authors relying on more than 14,000 studies from around the globe, bluntly lays out for policymakers and the public the most up-to-date understanding of the physical science on climate change. Released amid a summer of deadly fires, floods and heat waves, it arrives less than three months before a critical summit this November in Scotland, where world leaders face mounting pressure to move more urgently to slow the Earth’s warming.U.N. Secretary General António Guterres called the findings “a code red for humanity” and said societies must find ways to embrace the transformational changes necessary to limit warming as much as possible. “We owe this to the entire human family,” he said in a statement. “There is no time for delay and no room for excuses.”But so far, the collective effort to slow climate change has proved gravely insufficient.

WP,climate change,4,How climate change helped make Hurricane Ida one of Louisiana’s worst,https://t.co/NVTiHLHarp,"From its birth, the storm was destined to become a monster.It formed from air that was hot, moist and thick with clouds. It incubated in the sultry Gulf of Mexico, drawing power from water that was unusually warm.By the time Hurricane Ida made landfall in Port Fourchon, La., on Sunday, it was the poster child for a climate change-driven disaster. The fast-growing, ferocious storm brought 150-mile-per-hour wind, torrential rain and seven feet of storm surge to the most vulnerable part of the U.S. coast. It rivals the most powerful storm ever to strike the state.Though Ida was downgraded to a tropical depression Monday, it still poses a major threat as it makes its way across the southeast. Heavy rains could trigger flash flooding from Mississippi to Appalachia, including in areas where soils have already been saturated by an unusually wet summer.“This is exactly the kind of thing we’re going to have to get used to as the planet warms,” said Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies the physics of hurricanes and their connection to the climate.According to the United Nations’ latest climate report, warming from fossil fuel use and other human activities is likely behind an increase in the number of high intensity hurricanes in the past 40 years.Hurricane Ida is the latest storm to batter the United States this summer. Tropical Storm Henri weakened as it inundated coastal communities in New England earlier this month, but it still knocked out power to more than 120,000 homes in three states and dumped a record 1.89 inches of rain on New York City in just one hour.And hurricane season is far from over, as five other tropical systems are now sweeping over the Atlantic Ocean.But for now, all eyes are on Ida.Scientists had been bracing for the worst since the moment forecasters identified a tropical depression forming last week.

It found that American Indians and Alaska Natives are 48 percent more likely than other groups to live in areas that will be inundated by flooding from sea-level rise under that scenario, Latinos are 43 percent more likely to live in communities that will lose work hours because of intense heat, and Black people will suffer significantly higher mortality rates.The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius since the Industrial Revolution began, and is on track to warm by more than 1.5 degrees by the early 2030s.Joe Goffman, acting head of the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, said the comprehensive review was a “first of its kind.” It amounts to a federal acknowledgment of the broad and disproportionate effect that global warming is having on some of America’s most socially vulnerable groups. Just this week, the Department of Health and Human Services established the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity, the first federal program aimed at specifically examining how the burning of fossil fuels and other greenhouse gas emissions affect human health.The impact of Hurricane Ida, whose remnants Wednesday wreaked havoc in New Jersey and New York City, is still being calculated.

WP,climate change,6,"Climate change may have worsened deadly Texas cold wave, new study suggests",https://t.co/AaFZaSzaFh,"In a study released Thursday in the journal Science, the devastating Texas cold wave in February is linked to a stretching of the polar vortex in the stratosphere miles above ground level. This stretching mode, only recently categorized, has become more common over the last 40 years, the paper finds, and the increase may be related to human-caused climate change.Led by Judah Cohen, a climate scientist at Atmospheric and Environment Research, the new study is the latest salvo in a decade-long debate over how Arctic warming may be driving some winter extremes in the mid-latitudes, paradoxically leading to intense cold spells in a warming climate.The stratospheric polar vortex is a semi-permanent pool of cold air over the poles about 10 to 30 miles high, encircled by strong winds. When the vortex is split in two, or stretched out, associated shifts in the jet stream at lower altitudes can push frigid surface air into the mid-latitudes, including the United States.The stretched-polar-vortex concept was first brought into the dialogue with a 2018 paper in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society by Marlene Kretschmer of the University of Potsdam; Cohen was a co-author. A stretched vortex can pull a frigid air mass from high latitudes and drive it toward low latitudes even more effectively than when the vortex is weakened and split and a piece of it moves to lower latitudes, the mode that has been studied more closely.The new study uses observations to identify the stretched vortex as an increasingly prevalent mode since 1980, and one that is especially likely to be related to intense mid-latitude cold outbreaks. The authors then use climate modeling to show that changes in Arctic sea ice and Eurasian snow cover may be fostering the stretched mode and contributing to high-impact winter weather extremes.This year’s Texas cold wave, which the study identifies as related to vortex stretching, caused close to 150 deaths and at least $20 bi",The Texas cold wave in February linked to a stretching of the polar vortex in the stratosphere.

NYT,climate change,2,A ‘Code Red for Humanity’,https://t.co/dGNJUK1ULF,"AdvertisementtranscriptFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.The secretary general of the United Nations called it a, quote, “code red for humanity.”Today: I spoke with my colleague Henry Fountain about what we’re learning from a major new report on climate change.It’s Friday, August 13.So, Henry, a few days ago, a report on climate change was released. And before we talk through it, I want to give voice to what I think may be the feeling of deja vu that those words inspire — a climate report has been released. Because it seems like every few months, a report is released that says, basically, things are bad when it comes to the climate. They’re going to get worse. And time is running out to fix it. So what is different and important about this climate report?Well, first of all, this is a report by this U.N. body, right? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And that’s the definitive group that’s doing this kind of work. It’s a couple of hundred scientists. They’ve reviewed something like 14,000 scientific papers. So it’s got a lot of heft behind it. You know, it really is the be all and end all of these kind of reports.The other thing that just makes it really compelling, I think, is, when it’s being released. It was released on Monday. And as everybody knows, we’re in the middle of this extreme summer of bad wildfires, really awful drought, incredible heat waves, flooding in Germany that nobody expected to see in 100 years. So it comes at a time when people are really attuned to what’s going on.Right, so to summarize, this is the bible of climate reports emerging in a summer of astonishing climate extremes.Yeah, absolutely.OK, so given that, what does this report say?

NYT,climate change,3,"Climate Change Contributed to Europe’s Deadly Floods, Scientists Find",https://t.co/902I29DG8a,"AdvertisementBy Henry FountainThe violent and deadly flooding in Germany and Belgium last month was an extremely rare event, scientists said Monday, but one that was made more likely by climate change.The scientists found that the record rainfall that led to the flooding, including a 24-hour total of 3.5 inches in the Ahr and Erft river valleys in western Germany, was a 400-year event, meaning in any given year there was a 1-in-400 chance of such a downpour occurring in the region.But the analysis showed that while rare, such an event was 1.2 to 9 times more likely now than it would have been more than a century ago, before emissions of heat-trapping gases warmed the world by more than 1 degree Celsius (about 2 degrees Fahrenheit).And if the world warms to 2 degrees Celsius, as is likely without drastic cuts in emissions, the probability of such an event would increase even more, becoming 1.2 to 1.4 times likely as currently.“It’s still a rare event,” said Maarten van Aalst, director of the International Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Center, who contributed to the research. “But it is an event we should be increasingly prepared for.”The researchers also found that warming had increased the intensity, or amount of precipitation, of such a heavy rainfall by 3 percent to 19 percent. And at 2 degrees Celsius, the intensity would increase another 0.8 percent to 6 percent. Both findings are in keeping with a basic fact of climate change, that warmer air holds more moisture.The heavy rains in mid-July caused floodwaters to surge through river valleys in north-central Europe, carving up villages and leaving destruction and death behind. More than 220 people were killed, most of them in Germany.During the flooding, the peak flow of the relatively small Ahr River was closer to that of the Rhine, one of Europe’s largest. “You had a huge river for a short amount of time rushing through the valley of the Ahr,” said Enno Nilson, of the German Federal In","The violent and deadly flooding in Germany and Belgium was a 400-year event, scientists say.

NYT,climate change,5,Ida strengthened quickly int a monster. Here's how,https://t.co/oAQhz5YEdP,"AdvertisementBy Henry FountainHurricane Ida, which struck the Louisiana coast on Sunday with winds of 150 miles an hour, gained power faster more than most storms. Because of climate change, such rapid strengthening is happening more often as hurricanes pick up more energy from ocean water that is warmer than before.But in a summer of extreme weather, Ida’s intensification was extreme.According to the National Hurricane Center’s forecast bulletins, the storm’s maximum sustained winds as of Saturday morning were about 85 m.p.h., making it a Category 1 hurricane. Less than 24 hours later they were 65 m.p.h. stronger, bringing Ida close to a Category 5.The storm intensified more than the hurricane center’s forecast, which had called for maximum winds reaching 140 m.p.h. The hurricane center’s definition of rapid intensification is at least a 35 m.p.h. increase in wind speed in 24 hours. Ida strengthened that much in just six hours overnight.Climate change is part of the reason. Researchers have found that the frequency of rapidly intensifying Atlantic hurricanes has increased over the past four decades as ocean temperatures have risen, in large part because warmer water provides more of the energy that fuels these storms. In the 1980s, there was about a 1 percent chance that a hurricane would undergo rapid intensification. Now, there’s a 5 percent chance.But experts who study the behavior of hurricanes said other factors played a role with Ida, including seasonal warming of the Gulf of Mexico, the amount of moisture in the atmosphere and the presence or absence of winds that can affect the structure of a storm.Right now the Gulf is extremely warm because it accumulated heat throughout the summer. It’s this seasonal warming, which happens in the Atlantic Ocean as well, that makes mid-August through October the most active part of the hurricane season every year.But it’s not just the surface temperature of the Gulf that’s important, said Joshua",Hurricane Ida gained power faster than most storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Climate change is part of the reason for Ida's rapid intensification,"The rapid stengthening of this storm cannot be blamed entirely on climate change. That is misleading.

It also allows private citizens to bring civil litigation with a threat of $10,000 or more in damages against providers or anyone who helped a woman access an abortion after six weeks.In a statement on Thursday after the Supreme Court formally denied a request to freeze the law, Biden said it was an ""unprecedented assault on a woman's constitutional rights under Roe v.

This is often called the ""motherhood penalty.""But the data on the effects of limited reproductive freedom are just as telling.Being denied an abortion causes massive financial distress. And that distress is disproportionately harmful to poorer women and women of color. The effect of being denied an abortionCritics of the law, which prohibits abortions as early as six weeks, say the measure ignores that people who seek abortions are disproportionately poor and disproportionately people of color.""Many people seeking abortions already face difficult financial circumstances,"" said Caitlin Myers, professor of economics at Middlebury College.

""I'll add one more 'very,' "" the liberal Justice told NPR in an interview published Thursday. ""And I wrote a dissent.

In an unsigned opinion, the majority wrote that while the abortion providers had raised ""serious questions regarding the constitutionality of the Texas law,"" they had not met a burden that would allow the court to block it at this time due to ""complex"" and ""novel"" procedural questions.All three of former President Donald Trump's appointees -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett -- voted with the majority to let the Texas law remain in effect.Under the law, abortion is prohibited when a fetal heartbeat is detected, and there is no exception for rape or incest -- although there is an exemption for ""medical emergencies.""""Texas's law delegates to private individuals the power to prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion during the first stage of pregnancy,"" Breyer wrote in dissent.

The law gives private citizens the power to enforce it.This order applies only to Texas Right to Life and is part of a larger -- and piecemeal -- approach by abortion rights advocates to try to blunt the effect of the law. Other short-term temporary restraining orders are in place against other anti-abortion advocates, and more permanent injunctions are being sought in those cases.But the impact of the Texas law, which the Supreme Court allowed to stand earlier this month, has already been felt as abortion clinics in the state have largely stopped performing abortions for women more than six weeks pregnant for fear of litigation from private parties.The injunction against Texas Right to Life is effective immediately and replaces a temporary restraining order that was issued earlier this month. It will remain in effect until at least April 2022, when a trial is scheduled on the merits of the case.In a court hearing Monday, Julie Murray, the attorney for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told the judge that the organization is currently ""complying with SB8 precisely because of the overwhelming threats of litigation"" and that a temporary injunction ""will not restore abortion services ... but it will prevent and reduce the litigation exposure and constitutional harms that [Planned Parenthood] will experience.""The parties spent nearly two hours coming to an agreement about the terms of the in",A Texas judge issues an injunction against the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life.

""How we bishops deal with this principle. We must be pastors, also with those who are excommunicated. Like God with passion and tenderness. The Bible says so.""His comments come amid a simmering debate within the US Catholic Church over granting communion to Catholic politicians who support abortion rights, including the nation's second Catholic President. Biden had been denied the sacrament in the run-up to the election and the issue drew new attention in June when the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops proceeded with a plan that could deny communion to such public figures, setting up a potential public rebuke of the President.By a vote of 168 to 55, with six abstentions, the bishops had gone forward with plans for a report on the meaning of the Eucharist in the church. The vote is part of a longer process, and the Vatican would have to approve any action on behalf of the bishops.Catholics for Choice, a liberal Catholic group that advocates for abortion rights, said at the time that it was ""profoundly saddened"" by the vote and condemned using the Eucharist ""as a weapon of punishment.""""In a country and church already riven with tension and division, today the bishops chose to be partisan instead of pastoral, cruel rather than Christ-like,"" the group said.

Wade.The Biden administration urged the Supreme Court Monday to uphold Roe v. Wade -- the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 24 weeks of pregnancy -- and to invalidate the Mississippi law that bars most abortions after 15 weeks. Acting Solicitor General Brian H. Fletcher said in new friend-of-the-court briefs filed in advance of the December 1 arguments that the justices should reject a direct challenge to the landmark opinion. In a separate filing, he also asked that the United States be granted time to argue its position during oral arguments. Overruling Roe, he said, ""would harm women (and their partners) who have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fall.""Fletcher said it would ""seriously undermine women's autonomy"" and that the effects would likely ""be felt most acutely by young women, women of color, and those of lesser means.""The Mississippi case -- the most important set of abortion-related oral arguments the court has heard since 1992 -- comes as states across the country, emboldened by the conservative majority and the addition of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the high court, are increasingly passing restrictive abortion-related regulations, hoping to curb the constitutional right first established in 1973 in Roe and reaffirmed in 1992 when the court handed down Planned Parenthood v.

Anyone can read what you share.By Natalie Kitroeff and Oscar LopezMEXICO CITY — Criminalizing abortion is unconstitutional, Mexico’s Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday, setting a precedent that could lead to legalization of the procedure across this conservative Catholic country of about 130 million people.The unanimous ruling from the nation’s top court follows years of efforts by a growing women’s movement in Mexico that has repeatedly taken to the streets of major cities to demand greater rights and protections.The decision, which opens the door for Mexico to become the most populous Latin American country to allow abortion, was met with elation by feminist activists and dismay by conservative politicians and the powerful Catholic Church.“Today is a historic day for the rights of all Mexican women,” Chief Justice Arturo Zaldívar said after the judges’ votes were cast. “It is a watershed in the history of the rights of all women, especially the most vulnerable.”The decision does not automatically make abortion legal across Mexico, experts said, but it does set a binding precedent for judges across the country. Abortion rights advocates said they planned to use the ruling to challenge laws in the vast majority of Mexican states that mandate jail time or other criminal penalties for women who have the procedure.For now, analysts said, women arrested for having an abortion can sue state authorities to have the charges dropped.

Garland called Texas’ enforcement mechanism “an unprecedented” effort whose “obvious and expressly acknowledged intention” was to prevent women from exercising their constitutionally protected right to have abortions.“This kind of scheme to nullify the Constitution of the United States is one that all Americans — whatever their politics or party — should fear,” Mr. Garland said in a news conference at the Justice Department. “If it prevails, it may become a model for action in other areas, by other states, and with respect to other constitutional rights and judicial precedents.”The Justice Department is seeking an injunction that would prohibit enforcement of the Texas law. “It is settled constitutional law that ‘a state may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability,’” the lawsuit said. “But Texas has done just that.” Even though the Supreme Court declined last week to block the Texas law, known as Senate Bill 8, it did so without ruling on whether it is constitutional.

Several other states have tried over the years to limit or ban abortions before fetal viability but have not managed to maneuver past the courts.Texas lawmakers did so through a unique legal approach. The law, Senate Bill 8, bans most abortions after about six weeks — before many people know they are pregnant — and authorizes citizens to enforce it. Abortion providers in Texas said that 85 to 90 percent of the procedures they previously performed were after the six-week mark.To better understand what S.B. 8 says and does, I read the law in its entirety and consulted with two professors who have expertise in abortion jurisprudence — Mary Ziegler of Florida State University, who has written several books on abortion law, including “Abortion and the Law in America: Roe v. Wade to the Present,” and Melissa Murray of New York University, who co-wrote the first casebook on reproductive law and is a host of “Strict Scrutiny,” a podcast about the Supreme Court.Professor Murray cautioned that parts of the law were written so vaguely that they “could reasonably be subject to a wide range of interpretations.”Here’s the full law in a PDF.Section 171.203 (Page 3): A physician may not knowingly perform or induce an abortion on a pregnant woman unless the physician has determined, in accordance with this section, whether the woman’s unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat. … The physician must use a test that is: consistent with the physician’s good faith and reasonable understanding of standard medical practice; and appropriate for the estimated gestational age of the unborn child and the condition of the pregnant woman a","We took the text of S.B. 8, which bans almost all abortions in Texas and delegates enforcement responsibility to citizens.

Pitman of the Western District of Texas to issue a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction that would prevent enforcement of the law.“This relief is necessary to protect the constitutional rights of women in Texas and the sovereign interest of the United States,” the Justice Department said in its brief.Representatives for Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.The Justice Department’s filing is the latest salvo in the Biden administration’s fight to stop Texas from enacting a law that prohibits most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, often before many women are aware they are pregnant.

He cited a history of atrocities committed in the name of the faith when the church became involved in politics.“What must the pastor do?” he asked. “Be a pastor, don’t go condemning. Be a pastor, because he is a pastor also for the excommunicated.”The issue has become one of the deepest rifts within the church in the United States, as well as between the American church and the Vatican.

David GoodmanHOUSTON — A man in Arkansas and another in Illinois on Monday filed what appeared to be the first legal actions under a strict new abortion law in Texas that is enforced by ordinary citizens, regardless of where they live.The Arkansas man, Oscar Stilley, who was described in the complaint as a “disbarred and disgraced” lawyer, said in an interview that he had filed the lawsuit against a Texas doctor, who publicly wrote about performing an abortion, to test the provisions of the law. The Supreme Court declined to stop the law, which has effectively ended most abortions in the state since going into effect this month.The law bars enforcement by state officials, a novel maneuver aimed at circumventing judicial review, and instead relies on citizens to file legal claims against abortion providers or anyone suspected of “aiding or abetting” an abortion. Successful suits can bring the plaintiffs awards of at least $10,000.Proponents of the law and anti-abortion activists had been satisfied that the threat of legal action appeared to stop most abortions in Texas. Some feared that the openness of the law — allowing anyone to file suit — could result in a first test case that was unfavorable to their cause.Mr. Stilley said he was not trying to halt abortions by Dr. Alan Braid, a San Antonio physician who wrote in The Washington Post on Saturday that he had violated the Texas law — which prohibits abortions after cardiac activity is detected, or roughly six weeks into pregnancy.“I’m not pro-life,” Mr. Stilley, 58, said in an interview. “The thing that I’m trying to vindicate here is the law.

(OkCupid’s parent company, Match Group, is headquartered in Dallas.)The badge, comparable to a virtual bumper sticker, will appear on profiles directly below biographical details — such as name, age and location — making it immediately visible to anyone who’s swiping. For every profile that adds the badge, OkCupid will donate $1 to Planned Parenthood.In recent years, OkCupid has offered users different badges to signal their stance on various political issues, including a “Black Lives Matter” badge and a “Voter” badge. In May, the company added an “I’m Vaccinated” badge to its slate of identifiers.OkCupid’s abortion-rights badge was developed after the Supreme Court decided in early September not to block the Texas law that bans most abortions after six weeks and allows citizens to sue anyone who helps a patient receive an abortion. Signaling support of abortion rights was already gaining purchase with OkCupid users: Between September 2020 and September 2021, the number of users in the United States who wrote “pro-choice” in their bios increased by about 18 percent, the company said.Sarah Lynn Robinson, 30, a dating coach, was one of those users.

Wade when it hears a case challenging Mississippi’s restrictive abortion law later this year, arguing that any other decision would uphold an unconstitutional law and undermine a doctrine that gives power to Supreme Court precedents.The department also asked for permission to present oral arguments when the case is heard on Dec. 1, an indication of the significance of this particular legal fight in the larger effort to overturn Roe and enact abortion bans across the country.The briefs, filed by the acting solicitor general, Brian H. Fletcher, are the latest step by the Biden Justice Department to try to protect the legal right to an abortion. They came just weeks after the department sued Texas over a law that prohibits nearly all abortions in the state and asked a federal district judge to temporarily block the statute until the courts determine whether it is constitutional.The Justice Department was one of more than 40 parties to file a friend-of-the-court brief in support of Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the only abortion provider in Mississippi.

At a news conference, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the ban “is clearly unconstitutional under long-standing Supreme Court precedent.”“This kind of scheme to nullify the Constitution of the United States is one that all Americans, whatever their politics or party, should fear,” said Garland, warning that what he called the “bounty hunter” element of the law may become “a model for action in other areas by other states and with respect to other constitutional rights or judicial precedents.” The U.S. government, Garland added, has a responsibility “to ensure that no state can deprive individuals of their constitutional rights.”A spokeswoman for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) defended the law and accused the Biden administration of acting for political reasons — to distract Americans from the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.“We are confident that the courts will uphold and protect that right to life,” press secretary Renae Eze said in a statement.FAQ: What to know about the Texas abortion lawThe case has been assigned to District Court Judge Robert L.

Breyer is criticizing the high court’s refusal to block a Texas abortion statute that bans the procedure as early as six weeks into pregnancy, allowing the red state to implement the strictest antiabortion law in the nation. In an interview with NPR, the 83-year-old justice appointed by President Bill Clinton said the Supreme Court’s unsigned opinion last week “was very, very, very wrong — I’ll add one more very.”In a 5-to-4 decision, the court’s most consistent conservatives — Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr., plus President Donald Trump’s nominees to the court, Neil M. Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — said they would let the Texas law stand ahead of lower-court battles over whether it is constitutional.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joined the court’s three liberals, including Breyer, who argued to keep the law from being implemented as litigation plays out. The law allows private citizens to take legal action against anyone who helps a woman terminate her pregnancy — setting a $10,000 award to be paid by the defendant if the suing party prevails in court.“We thought that that particular case should not be decided just on an emergency basis,” Breyer said in the interview, “but it’s a procedural matter and so we’ll see what happens in that area when we get a substantive matter in front of us.”What to know about the Texas abortion lawThe court’s move drew sharp criticism from President Biden, who said the court’s action “unleashes unconstitutional chaos.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) pledged to call a vote on legislation that would enshrine a woman’s right to an abortion into federal law.Abortion providers say the ban effectively eliminates the guarantee in Roe v.

WP,Fight against Abortion Laws,3,"Mississippi abortion law would open door to extensive bans, providers tell Supreme Court",https://t.co/iUOWFvn0Y7,"Abortion providers told the Supreme Court on Monday that approving a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks would “scuttle a half-­century of precedent and invite states to ban abortion entirely.”They said in their brief that Mississippi’s request that the court overturn its 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade was based on the state’s hope that a “changed composition” of the court would reject years of legal precedent.To do so, said lawyers for the state’s only abortion clinic and a doctor, would be to “abandon a rule of law that this Court has said uniquely implicates the country’s ‘confidence in the Judiciary.’ ” The quoted statement is from the court’s 1992 decision in Casey v. Planned Parenthood, in which the court upheld the essential holding of Roe and said states may not impose an undue burden on a woman’s right to the procedure.The court’s review of the Mississippi law, which prohibits almost all abortions after 15 weeks of gestation, has taken on even more significance since the Supreme Court earlier this month let a more restrictive Texas law go into effect.The court said it was not ruling on the constitutionality of that law, which authorizes private citizens to sue those who aid or abet an abortion after six weeks, only whether challengers had made a proper showing it should be stopped before taking effect.Still, the 5-to-4 decision indicated the increasingly conservative court is more open to altering decades of Supreme Court precedents.Since Justice Amy Coney Barrett replaced the court’s most outspoken advocate of abortion rights, the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court now has a 6-to-3 conservative majority.

A minor from Galveston, who was raped by a family member, traveled eight hours to Oklahoma to terminate her pregnancy. Another patient made the six-hour trek for an out-of-state abortion alone, fearing that anyone who joined her in the car could face legal liability under Texas’s new abortion ban.The testimonials from providers about the impact of the nation’s most restrictive abortion law were included in the Biden administration’s emergency request to a federal judge in Austin to immediately block enforcement of the law, which bans abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy and makes no exceptions for rape, sexual abuse or incest. The request was filed late Tuesday night.The law, which took effect this month after the Supreme Court refused to block its enforcement, has “gravely and irreparably impaired women’s ability to exercise their constitutional right to an abortion across the State,” it says, adding that women with the ability to travel are seeking access to abortions in Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico and Colorado. Clinics in neighboring states are also receiving “panicked calls” from Texas patients and seeing large increases in patients younger than 18, survivors of sexual assault, older patients and cases involving serious fetal anomalies, according to the filing.Read the Justice Department's court filing from late Tuesday night“This experience has also been traumatic for our physicians and staff as they must tell patient after patient that they cannot care for them,” said the declaration from Melaney Linton, president of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast. “They are essentially being forced to inflict trauma on their patients.”The Justice Department sued the state of Texas last week to try to block the abortion law, which allows private citizens to file civil lawsuits against anyone who helps","Texas law bans abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy and makes no exceptions for rape, sexual abuse or incest.

He said he filed the claim not because of strongly held views about reproductive rights but in part because of the $10,000 he could receive if the lawsuit is successful. A second suit filed Monday — just four paragraphs long — came from a man in Chicago who asked a state court to strike down the abortion law as invalid.Since the Texas ban took effect Sept. 1, advocates on both sides of the abortion debate have been anticipating such lawsuits, though perhaps not from a “disbarred and disgraced former Arkansas lawyer,” as Oscar Stilley described himself in his complaint.The Supreme Court’s conservative majority said this month that an initial challenge to the law raised serious constitutional questions.

WP,Fight against Abortion Laws,6,Analysis: Texas’s abortion law is even more unpopular than we thought,https://t.co/EXCBTQhk4m,"When the Supreme Court gave an at-least-temporary go-ahead to Texas’s law banning abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, we and many others asked a question: Had Republicans caught the car on abortion?They have long pushed for overturning Roe v. Wade, but for decades that was much more hypothetical — a great motivator of the base — than reality. What happens politically when it looks as though that push might ultimately pay off by severely undercutting a Supreme Court precedent that a strong majority of Americans support?A new poll suggests that even what we knew at the time might have undersold just how dicey the Texas law could be for Republicans.The Monmouth University poll, as with many before it, shows Americans support leaving Roe on the books by 62 percent to 31 percent. It shows a similar 2-to-1 split when it comes to people supporting abortion being legal in most cases. And when asked specifically about the Supreme Court allowing the Texas law to go into effect, Americans disagreed with that decision 54 percent to 39 percent.But those margins pale in comparison with how some of the other specifics of the Texas law poll.One of the most contentious aspects of the law, beyond the six-week time frame, is in how it allows regular citizens to enforce it — by filing complaints about those who obtain abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected. Asked what they think about “having private citizens use lawsuits to enforce this law instead of having government prosecutors handle these cases,” Americans disapprove of the idea 70 percent to 22 percent.The pollster then noted that the law provides for compensation of $10,000 for private citizens who win such cases — what has been labeled a “bounty.” In this case, opposition was even higher: 81 percent to 14 percent.

The school's CEO and co-founder Leila Centner sent a letter to faculty and staff at the Centner Academy citing unsupported assertions about Covid-19 vaccines that contradict a large body of evidence of the vaccines' safety and efficacy from the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization. All four agencies, backed by extensive research, have confirmed that vaccines are the best method of defense against Covid-19 and contagious variants that can cause severe illness.  But the school is ignoring the advice and guidance from the state and federal governments, as well as the Miami-Dade Health Department, which all urge everyone 16 and older to be vaccinated.Centner claimed in the letter that ""it will be years before we have reliable information regarding the short- and long-term effects of the Covid-19 vaccines."" The FDA issued emergency use authorization for three vaccines after extensive testing showed they were both safe and effective. The letter makes other unsubstantiated claims about adverse reactions non-vaccinated people could have by ""interacting with people who have been vaccinated"" that have not been identified in or supported by research by the CDC, FDA, NIH or WHO. Centner concluded by asking employees to ""please wait until the school year ends"" to get vaccinated.

Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.CNN's Matthew Hilk and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report. About 8 million adolescents -- representing about a third of those ages 12 to 17 -- have been fully vaccinated so far, according to data published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fully vaccinated means that it has been two weeks since they completed a second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, the only vaccine authorized for those under 18. So far, CNN has identified at least seven states -- Arkansas, Arizona, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah  -- that have prohibited mask mandates in schools at the state-level. Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Tuesday he regrets approving a statewide ban on face mask mandates earlier this year and has called the state legislature into a special session in an effort to amend the law.Most of these states have vaccinated a smaller share of adolescents than the national average, including Oklahoma, South Carolina and Arkansas, which have each vaccinated fewer than one-fifth of adolescents.   Meanwhile, at least six states -- Connecticut, Hawaii, New Mexico, New York, Virginia and Washington -- require masks in schools, each of which has fully vaccinated a larger share of adolescents than the national average, including Connecticut, which is one of only three states to have vaccinated more than half of adolescents.

J.B. Pritzker announced Thursday that all PreK-12 public school teachers and staff, all higher-education personnel and students, and health care workers in a variety of settings must be vaccinated against Covid-19 by September 5 or face regular testing requirements.CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report.Illinois is also instituting a statewide indoor mask requirement, regardless of vaccination status, beginning Monday, he said. Pritzker said the requirements are aimed at protecting the most vulnerable residents -- children ineligible to be vaccinated and elderly people with weakened immune systems -- as well as hospitals with limited staffing and space.""My number one concern is right now keeping the health care system available, not just for people who may get Covid but for people who have other problems and are taken to the hospital,"" he said.From January to July, 98% of Covid-19 cases, 96% of hospitalizations and 95% of deaths were among unvaccinated, Pritzker said. The governor said the regions with the fewest number of vaccinated individuals are the same regions with ""fewer hospitals and lower hospital capacity"" and those communities are being hit the hardest.The new mandates coincide with the return to school and amid a recent rise in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations in Illinois, although infections and hospitalizations remain well below the winter peaks. The US Food and Drug Administration gave full approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, a move that opened the door for vaccine mandates.About 59% of Illinois residents 12 and older are fully vaccinated, slightly below the national average, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The city of Chicago reinstated an indoor mask mandate last week and on Wednesday announced plans to require city employees to be fully vaccinated by October 15.""The data shows t",Gov.

Students who participate in in-person extracurricular activities, including sports, face an earlier deadline of October 3 for a first dose of the vaccine and a second dose no later than October 31.The district, which includes more than 600,000 students, already mandates the vaccine for teachers and staff, requires face coverings be worn by all, and tests all students and staff for infections weekly. Classrooms have also been outfitted with enhanced ventilation systems in an effort to decrease the spread of the virus.Interim Superintendent Megan Reilly estimated there are about 225,000 students 12 and older in the district -- of which about 80,000 are unvaccinated, but she said the health department would have the specific numbers. In its daily update, Los Angeles County Public Health said more than half of 12- to 17-year-olds in the county are vaccinated.The mandate will apply to all vaccine eligible students who are attending school in-person and would allow those with ""qualified and approved exemptions"" to opt out, though the conditions weren't specified.

PetriChicago Public Schools will require everyone to wear masks in school buildings when the new academic year starts, regardless of their vaccination status, according to guidelines the school system released on Thursday.With the decision, Chicago joins New York City and several other large jurisdictions, including the state of California, in imposing stricter health guidelines for students and teachers than the federal government has recommended.In a letter to public school parents and children, Jose Torres, the interim chief executive of Chicago Public Schools, wrote that the rule on face covering would apply to students, staff members and visitors.“Continuing to require masks will help make sure those in our school communities who are not yet eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine, which encompasses the majority of our students, remain as safe as possible,” Mr. Torres wrote.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance earlier this month that called for a full return to classrooms in the fall and recommended that masks be optional for fully vaccinated students and staff.But the guidance left a lot of details up to state and local governments, advising districts to use local coronavirus data to guide decisions about when to tighten or relax prevention measures like masking and physical distancing. It also recommended that unvaccinated students and staff members keep wearing masks.Chicago’s announcement came a day after the Virginia Department of Health and Department of Education said that masks should be worn indoors in public elementary schools, regardless of vaccination status. The state’s return-to-school guidelines also encourage mask-wearing indoors in middle and high schools for those who are unvaccinated.

Health officials should reassess these figures weekly and change local restrictions accordingly, the agency said.By those criteria, all residents of Florida, Arkansas and Louisiana, for example, should wear masks indoors.

Cardona, is part of a broader “return to school road map” aimed at getting students back to in-person learning this fall. School officials around the country are worried that a surge in coronavirus cases, fueled by the highly infectious Delta variant, will threaten the return.Roughly 90 percent of the country’s educators are vaccinated, Dr. Cardona said during an appearance in the White House briefing room, and the administration sees vaccinating students as essential to keeping schools open. But experts and school superintendents said in interviews that increasing vaccination rates among students may be a slow and uphill battle.“When you look at a map of the United States and you see those states that have low vaccination rates and high infection rates, those are the areas where superintendents are having problems in getting kids vaccinated,” said Dan Domenech, executive director of AASA: The School Superintendents Association, which represents about 13,000 superintendents around the country.Young people ages 12 and older have been eligible for vaccination since May, when the Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Charlie Baker, who has vocally advocated for local control of school masking policy.Mr. Baker, a Republican in a deeply Democratic state, had come under pressure to make masks mandatory in schools, and a poll released last week suggested that 81 percent of Massachusetts voters support the idea.The state education board on Tuesday voted 9 to 1 to give the education commissioner, Jeffrey Riley, the power to issue a mandate. Mr. Riley is expected to issue the mandate this week, establishing uniform requirements ahead of school openings.Massachusetts has not joined the list of states — including New Jersey, Oregon and Washington — that require teachers to get the vaccine. According to a New York Times data tracker, 75 percent of Massachusetts’s population has received at least one dose, a higher rate than any state except Vermont.Under the current plan, nearly all public school students over age 5, regardless of vaccination status, will be expected to wear masks inside Massachusetts school buildings until at least October, when state officials will allow individual schools to lift the mandate as long as 80 percent of staff and students are vaccinated. Unvaccinated people would be required to continue wearing masks.Merrie Najimy, president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, called the vote “a significant advancement toward keeping our communities safe.” The union, the state’s largest, voted on Aug. 1 in favor of a mask mandate in schools.Advertisement",Massachusetts Gov.

The Los Angeles Unified School District is the second largest in the nation, serving over 600,000 students, and the mandate could set an important national precedent. Students would need their first vaccine dose by Nov. 21 and their second by Dec. 19 to begin the next semester fully inoculated. Those who turn 12 after those dates will have 30 days after their birthday to receive their first shot.Students participating in in-person extracurricular activities will need both shots by the end of October. The resolution mentions “qualified and approved exemptions,” but does not offer details.The district offers online independent study for those who opt out of in-person learning this year, but so far, only a tiny percentage of students have chosen it.The months before the mandate takes effect will allow the district to conduct outreach and educational programs for families. According to the Los Angeles County Department of Health, 58 percent of the district’s 12-to-18-year-olds have already received at least one vaccine dose.Los Angeles Unified has been operating vaccine clinics in schools, and has the nation’s broadest school testing program, screening all students and staff members weekly. Masks are required for every individual on campus, indoors and outdoors, and staff members must be vaccinated, with limited exceptions for serious medical conditions and sincerely held religious beliefs.“Our goal is to keep kids and teachers as safe as possible and in the classroom,” said Nick Melvoin, a Los Angeles school board member, in a written statement expressing support for the resolution. “A medical and scie",Los Angeles Unified School District is the second largest in the nation to mandate coronavirus vaccines.

But two officials familiar with the plan said that it would include new federal requirements for vaccination, and that its underlying message would be that the only way to return to some sense of normalcy was to get as many people vaccinated as possible.“We know that increasing vaccinations will stop the spread of the pandemic, will get the pandemic under control, will return people to normal life,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday. “That’s what our objective is, so we want to be specific about what we’re trying to achieve.”The Food and Drug Administration’s decision last month to grant full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has already prompted the Pentagon to require members of the military to be vaccinated.

So far, many large districts are succeeding at one — masking — but only a minority offer the others.In a sample of 100 large urban districts, including a district in each state, nine in 10 are requiring students to wear masks, according to the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington, which has been tracking districts’ responses to the pandemic since its start. Just one quarter are requiring teachers to be vaccinated. Fifteen are regularly testing students. And student quarantine policies are generally much less strict than they were last spring.New York City public schools, which start Monday, are an anomaly on several measures, including the absence of a remote option and a more strict approach with quarantines.So far this school year, there have been temporary closures but none of the 100 districts have stopped offering full-time, in-person school for Covid reasons. But many plans were hastily revised as school neared and as the Delta variant spread. (Children under 12 cannot be vaccinated and most likely will not be eligible until November. Nationwide, less than half of those ages 12 to 18 are fully vaccinated.)The biggest change has been offering a remote option to families not ready for a return to school.

But if you aren’t going to help, at least get out of the way,” Biden said. “The people are trying to do the right thing. Use your power to save lives.”When asked specifically about Republican Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas, Biden said that “their decisions are not good for their constituents.” DeSantis signed an executive order last week that prohibits schools from requiring masks, and Abbott signed an order that bans local governments and state agencies from mandating vaccines.Until now, Biden has largely sought to avoid statements that could exacerbate the partisan cast of the vaccine debate and has gone out of his way to praise Republicans who are promoting vaccinations. But the White House has grown increasingly frustrated with leaders who are actively seeking to block efforts to encourage or require vaccinations.Both governors have questioned the effectiveness of mandates.Before Biden spoke Tuesday, DeSantis blamed media “hysteria” for making conditions in Florida seem worse than they are.Renae Eze, a spokeswoman for Abbott, said in a statement: “Governor Abbott has been clear that we must rely on personal responsibility, not government mandates.

Fauci, the White House’s chief coronavirus medical adviser, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday. “We’ve got to go the extra step to get people vaccinated. You want to persuade them, that’s good … but for those who do not want, I believe mandates at the local level need to be done.”Fauci also said he hoped the Food and Drug Administration would grant full approval of the coronavirus vaccines — now under emergency use authorizations — within the next month, though he emphasized that FDA officials were operating independently. Once that happens, Fauci said he thinks businesses, colleges and universities, and other local entities would feel “empowerment” to enact more of their own mandates.“I strongly support that,” Fauci said, adding as he has in the past that he did not think the federal government would enact a nationwide vaccine mandate.The push comes as coronavirus cases in the United States rose 40 percent in the past week, while covid-related hospitalizations rose 36 percent in the same period. In addition, coronavirus cases among children are on the rise — with the school year set to begin in many districts across the country. Meanwhile, children younger than 12 remain ineligible for vaccination.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said on “Meet the Press” that she supported a vaccine mandate for teachers, in part to help protect children who could not yet be inoculated.

But de Blasio said that the FDA’s full approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine — seen as a boost to schools, businesses and government agencies that want to mandate vaccines — is a “game-changing moment.”Many Americans have said they were hesitant to get vaccinated because the FDA had given only emergency status to coronavirus vaccines, but that is no longer the case with Pfizer.“We’ve been waiting for this for a long time,” de Blasio said. “This helps us move forward.”New Jersey Gov.

WP,School vaccination,5,"Miami private school says teachers who get coronavirus vaccine aren’t welcome, citing debunked...",https://t.co/4w565gDra5,"Last week, leaders at the Centner Academy, a Miami private school, sent teachers an email with a stark warning: Skip the coronavirus vaccines or else you’re not welcome in the classroom.“We cannot allow recently vaccinated people to be near our students until more information is known,” the school’s co-founder Leila Centner said in a letter first reported on by the New York Times.Centner cited debunked misinformation to justify the policy, suggesting that “reports have surfaced recently of non-vaccinated people being negatively impacted by interacting with people who have been vaccinated,” despite medical consensus that the coronavirus vaccines effectively prevent serious infections and carry few risks. The school’s decision alarmed public health experts and demonstrated the pervasive reach of misinformation about the vaccines, which have now been given to at least 141 million people in the United States. A dozen state attorneys general last month demanded that Facebook and Twitter do more to enforce policies against vaccine misinformation.The Centner Academy is in Miami’s swanky Design District, known for art galleries, shopping and architecture. Tuition starts at $15,160 for part-time preschoolers and runs up to $29,850 for its middle school students.In her letter to teachers last week and a second note sent to parents on Monday, the school’s co-founder alluded to misinformation about the vaccines’ impact on fertility and menstruation in women and girls and inaccurately suggested that vaccinated individuals “may be transmitting something” to unvaccinated people. Experts agree that vaccinated people cannot “shed” the vaccines and spread their effects to unvaccinated individuals.None of the coronavirus vaccines approved for use in the United States have been linked to infertility, miscarriages or any other adverse impact on women’s reproductive health.

Many companies have done the same, and President Biden on Thursday ordered all businesses with more than 100 employees to require their workers to be immunized or face weekly testing and said he would require all federal employees to get the shots.Megan K. Reilly, interim superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, told the school board that vaccinations will facilitate in-person education, which she and many others argue is best for children. She cited data showing far higher infection and hospitalization rates for those who remain unvaccinated. “The science is clear,” she said.The school board unified behind her, with one member after the next explaining the need to follow advice of experts. The measure passed in a 6-to-0 vote, with one member recusing himself because of a possible conflict of interest.“In order to keep our schools safe and open for our kids to learn, we must use the strongest tool in our tool kit, and that is the vaccine,” board president Kelly Gonez said.But during public comments, the challenge ahead became clear as three Spanish-speaking parents all spoke against the policy, saying vaccination should be a personal decision and arguing the vaccines are risky. It’s also possible the rules could be challenged in court.“This decision should be made by parents, not by you,” said one mother, speaking th",Los Angeles is by far the largest school district in the country to take this step.

The Serbian lost in three sets 4-6 7-6 3-6 to the world No. 11 at the Ariake Tennis Centre Court. Coming into the Olympics, Djokovic had been attempting to win what would've been a historic 'Golden Slam' in men's tennis. A 'Golden Slam' consists of winning all four grand slams and an Olympic gold medal in the same calendar year. Steffi Graf is the only tennis player -- male or female -- to complete the feat when she did it in 1988.However, defeat on Friday to Alexander Zverev in the semifinal dashed those hopes.Djokovic had a chance of taking home some silverware in mixed doubles.

He won the tournament in both 2018 and 2019 before last year’s edition was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.“I’m trying to peak at the majors; I’ve been managing to do that throughout my career,” Djokovic said in his pretournament news conference on Saturday. “I’ve had the fortune to really play my best tennis when it mattered the most.”This tournament might matter more for Djokovic than any before. It could be his 20th career Grand Slam singles title, which would tie Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the career lead. Having already won the first two major tournaments of the season, Djokovic could also become the first man to head to New York with the chance to win the U.S. Open and a Grand Slam since Rod Laver did so in 1969. This being an Olympic year, Djokovic would also have a chance to win a “Golden Slam,” only achieved by Steffi Graf in 1988, if he wins gold in Tokyo.“Once I’m on the court, I try to lock in and I try to exclude all the distractions,” Djokovic said. “I feel like over the years I managed to develop the mechanism that allows me to do that.”The top-seeded Djokovic slipped early on the slick grass and on the scoreboard, but found his footing on Monday afternoon on Centre Court to beat Jack Draper, a Briton who earned a wild card, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2.

Just as important, it gave Djokovic his third Grand Slam title of the year and positioned him to become the first man in more than a half-century to win the calendar Grand Slam when he competes at the U.S. Open later this summer.Djokovic won the Australian Open in February, the French Open last month and captured the Wimbledon title for a sixth time on Sunday, successfully defending the title he won in 2019, the last time Wimbledon was held.Rod Laver was the last man to win the calendar year Grand Slam, in 1969. Since then, no male player has arrived at the U.S. Open holding three Grand Slam titles in the same year.“Winning Wimbledon was always the biggest dream of mind when I was a kid,” said Djokovic, who constructed his own Wimbledon trophy as a kid. “Standing with a sixth Wimbledon, it’s incredible.”Djokovic has even given himself a chance to attain the so-called Golden Slam, which is the four major championships plus the singles gold medal in the Olympics. Djokovic has yet to decide whether he will compete at the Tokyo Olympics, which is scheduled to begin in less than two weeks.

Djokovic played the match like he had a dinner reservation to get to, winning in just 70 minutes.The roars arrived in the first game of the second set, when Nishikori had his lone chance to break Djokovic’s serve.

I’ve done that and the result wasn’t great,” Djokovic said. He added: “The exhaustion, both mental and physical, got to me and it’s unfortunate that the most important matches just didn’t deliver.

But Djokovic also knew that it was just a matter of time until he adapted to the Spaniard’s topspin-laden blasts, unique in tennis, and could seize the upper hand.Through a combination of devilish drop shots, line-painting backhands, unreturnable forehands and unshakable belief, Djokovic took charge in a match of exceptional quality and wild momentum shifts, defeating Nadal, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, to claim what he called one of the greatest victories of his career.The victory, which spanned daylight to night, not only put Djokovic into the final, but it denied Nadal the chance to move past Roger Federer and stand alone atop men’s tennis with 21 majors.

And from the outset, the 6-foot-5, 209-pound Berrettini unleashed a barrage of forehand blasts and service winners to signal his determination to get a different outcome.Djokovic dropped the first set 7-5 while searching for a higher gear. On the changeover that followed, Djokovic slipped into the Zenlike trance he often adopts at low ebbs, centered his emotions and reminded himself that he was built for the long haul — even if, at 34, he is nine years senior to Berrettini.At U.S. Open, a pair of teen semifinalists breathes joyful life into the women's drawFrom that point, Djokovic reeled off the next three sets to move within two victories of becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win the sport’s four majors in the same year.“I was just calm at that point,” Djokovic said of his process after ceding the opening set. “Whatever happened, move on. Then I felt I kind of reached another level of focus and calmness at the same time that helped me, I guess, read his game better, perfect my game.”Berrettini bordered on awe in describing the way Djokovic elevated his game over the final three sets, virtually eliminating unforced errors while firing back the Italian’s 135-mph serves as if routine. At one point, Berrettini wondered aloud whether claiming the opening set had worked against him because it seemed to rouse a beast in his opponent.The absence of Americans late in the U.S. Open is historic -- and a long time coming“Actu",Novak Djokovic beats Italian Matteo Berrettini in quarterfinals of U.S. Open.

Who else has completed the Grand Slam? How do Medvedev and Djokovic match up? The path to the final NEW YORK — Over the past decade, Novak Djokovic has set about transforming himself into an athlete with virtually no tactical, physical or psychological weakness.His endgame was audacious: to not only insert himself into the two-way conversation of tennis greatness being waged by Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal but to stake his claim as the greatest man ever to play the game.Sunday’s U.S. Open final represented the last step, but it was derailed by Daniil Medvedev, who staged a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 upset that halted Djokovic’s bid for the Grand Slam, which hasn’t been achieved by a man since Rod Laver in 1969, and denied the men’s record 21st major that would have broken Djokovic’s three-way tie with Federer and Nadal.With Medvedev’s victory, achieved in a ruthlessly efficient 2 hours 15 minutes before a capacity crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium that had come to witness history, the debate over the greatest man to play the game will no doubt continue.Gracious in victory, Medvedev offered his opinion during his post-match remarks.

WP,Djokovic,7,Vaccination requirements may keep Novak Djokovic from Australian Open,https://t.co/6HHdxPRVFu,"After Novak Djokovic expressed uncertainty about whether he would play in the Australian Open early next year because of coronavirus restrictions for the tournament, the premier of the state of Victoria warned players Tuesday to get vaccinated or risk being unable to participate.Daniel Andrews said players’ ability to get a visa may hinge on their vaccination status.“I don’t think an unvaccinated tennis player is going to get a visa to come into this country,” Andrews said during a news conference (via the Australian), “and if they did get a visa, they’d probably have to quarantine for a couple of weeks when no other player has to. ... I don’t think any other tennis player, or golfer, or Formula One driver, will even get a visa to get here.”Washington State coach fired for refusing to comply with vaccine requirementAndrews’s remarks sent a strong message, particularly to Djokovic, the top-ranked player in the world. The 20-time Grand Slam champion, who won his ninth Australian Open title last year before going on to win the French Open and Wimbledon, declined Monday to say whether he had been vaccinated, as he has in the past. He added that he was unsure whether he would play in the Australian Open, which is scheduled to begin Jan. 17.“[The virus] doesn’t care what your tennis ranking is or how many Grand Slams you’ve won,” Andrews said. “It’s completely irrelevant. You need to be vaccinated to keep yourself safe and to keep others safe.”The 2021 Australian Open was pushed back three weeks, and with vaccines not yet widely available, players were required to quarantine in a hotel for two weeks upon arriving in the country.

La Monica and Charles Riley, CNN BusinessUpdated 6:01 AM ET, Tue April 13, 2021 New York/London (CNN Business)Bitcoin has rocketed to a new record above $62,700 as investors gear up for this week's eagerly awaited direct listing of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global. Bitcoin has more than doubled in price this year, and it represents just over half of the overall cryptocurrency market's value of nearly $2.1 trillion. That's only slightly less than the stock market value of Apple (AAPL). On Tuesday, bitcoin prices surged as much as 4.7% to an all-time high above $62,700. The currency first topped $60,000 in early March amid signs that it would gain more mainstream acceptance as a store of value.Even large corporations are embracing bitcoin. Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA) has decided to invest some of its corporate cash in bitcoin, and accept it for some car purchases. Software firm MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced Monday that it will start to pay fees to directors of the company's board who are not employees in bitcoin instead of cash.  Shares of Silvergate Capital (SI), a bank that specializes in crypto-backed loans and deposits, have more than doubled this year. Coinbase's debut, set for Wednesday, could be a catalyst for the recent bitcoin and broader crypto surge. Coinbase is profitable and has reported strong revenue growth, and that could further help validate crypto buying and selling as a business.Based on recent private stock trades for Coinbase, the company is valued at a stunning level of nearly $68 billion. To put that into context, it's a little bit more than the market value of New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).""The Coinbase direct listing is a major milestone for the crypto industry. It will allow investors to gain exposure to the business without having to own actual cryptocurrencies,"" said Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, a digital asset securities firm.

Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that features the face of a Shiba Inu dog as its logo, has surpassed 10 cents for the first time.The virtual currency, which originally started as an internet parody more than seven years ago, has surged more than 85% in the last 24 hours and is trading at $0.13, according to CoinDesk. Its market cap is now over $17 billion. The latest surge comes as investors gear up for the direct listing of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global, which could further help validate crypto buying and selling as a business. Bitcoin also rocketed to a new record above $62,700 this week ahead of that listing, and other cryptocurrencies have also enjoyed big gains. But Dogecoin's rise is noteworthy. The currency has soared more than 2,000% from the start of the year, and has a big fan in Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose tweets about it have on occasion driven up Dogecoin's value.Dogecoin has also enjoyed something of a cult status on Reddit, where a popular group — not unlike the WallStreetBets group behind GameStop's rally — decided earlier this year to propel its value ""to the moon."" Dogecoin soared over 600% in the wake of that push.Musk is Dogecoin's richest fan, but he has previously been critical of the more established bitcoin, once calling it ""BS"" in a tweet. In a February interview on social app Clubhouse, though, Musk said he should have bought that digital currency eight years ago. His company Tesla has also promised customers that they can buy their cars with bitcoin.Coinbase, meanwhile, is set for its debut Wednesday.

After the cryptocurrency suffered a flash crash on Saturday — plummeting some 14% — it attempted to bounce back Monday. But the rebound fizzled out quickly.Bitcoin fell 0.7% against the US dollar around the time of the stock market close Monday, trading around $56,000 per coin.The weekend plunge was a rather dramatic end to a months-long rally that was topped off by Coinbase's enormous IPO last week, which valued the crypto exchange at nearly $100 billion. Coinbase shares dropped 2.6% Monday.Bitcoin had tumbled because of ""some countries like Turkey making noise about banning Bitcoin as a payment methodology and also talk of further scrutiny by the US Treasury,"" said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies. The crypto market is also getting more crowded: China is creating a digital yuan and is toying with the idea of rolling out the currency at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. Meanwhile, the Bank of England announced the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency as well as a task force to explore its uses.""Big Tech is also developing their own versions of cryptocurrencies,"" said analysts at Action Economics in a note to clients. ""All this represents significant future competition for the likes of bitcoin.""At the same time, the cryptocurrency still has plenty of bullish backers.""We don't think any of these factors change the fundamental story for Bitcoin which still seems supported by constrained supply and broadening institutional and retail investor adoption,"" wrote Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, in a note.

Other digital currencies followed bitcoin lower, with ethereum losing 14% and dogecoin shedding nearly 20%.Musk cited bitcoin's high environmental cost as reason for the move, after months of being bullish on it.""We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,"" Musk said in a note posted on Twitter Wednesday. ""Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment."" Tesla did not immediately respond to questions regarding the move, including how many vehicles have been purchased with bitcoin and whether Musk was previously unaware of its environmental impact.The environmental cost of mining — or creating — digital currencies has been well-documented for years, with the debate around them reignited in recent months as cryptocurrency-based tokens known as NFTs exploded in popularity. Tesla (TSLA) and Musk have appeared fairly bullish on bitcoin for at least a few months, with the company disclosing in February that it had invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin and floating the ability to buy its cars using the cryptocurrency. Musk tweeted in late March that people ""can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin.""Musk, who has in the past expressed skepticism about cryptocurrencies, said in an interview on social app Clubhouse earlier this year that he thinks bitcoin is on the verge of ""getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people.""

The world's most heavily traded cryptocurrency plunged as low as $30,202 per coin early Wednesday after starting the day around the $40,000 mark, according to data from Coindesk.Bitcoin then recovered slightly but was still down more than 10% at around $38,700 per coin around the time of the New York stock market close.Alongside bitcoin's fall Wednesday, several other major cryptos also were down. Ethereum plummeted below $2,000 per unit after trading above $3,000 on Tuesday, before reclaiming some of its lost ground. Ether was down around 22% at nearly $2,600 Wednesday afternoon. The meme-turned-cryptocurrency dogecoin lost more than 24% of its value.Cyrpto trading platforms Coinbase (COIN) and Coindesk experienced outages as a result of the selloff.Bitcoin was already dropping this month after Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said he was wary of its environmental impact.

This seriously harms the safety of people's property and disturbs normal economic and financial orders,"" said the statement from regulators supervised by the People's Bank of China and the China Insurance and Banking Commission.China's chilly stance toward cryptocurrency goes back years.

While Elon Musk isn't the only reason for the crypto carnage, he certainly isn't helping. Whether it's going on ""Saturday Night Live"" and joking that dogecoin is a ""hustle"" or having his epiphany that bitcoin mining may not be great for the environment, Musk's behavior has cryptocurrency bulls wishing he would stop tweeting and focus more on building cars instead. Bitcoin (XBT) fans are tired of Musk exerting so much influence over the near-term price movements of seemingly all cryptocurrencies.""People who followed Musk blindly have lost a lot of money. They may have gotten burned and never come back,"" said Alex Mashinsky, CEO and founder of Celsius, a crypto lending platform that offers digital tokens as rewards to customers — similar to a publicly traded company paying a dividend. ""The crypto community needs to be more responsible in how it explains these assets and the risk,"" Mashinsky added. ""Pundits kept saying we'd never see a down market for bitcoin again because of institutional interest, Square and PayPal, etc. When you hear that, you have to worry.""Investors and analysts are particularly irked by that all cryptocurrencies have been rising and falling with bitcoin and dogecoin — in part due to Musk making flip-flopping remarks about them. Some crypto investors are also annoyed, to put it mildly, that a comment from Musk can move prices so wildly. ""Musk is very calculated,"" said Eloisa Marchesoni, an angel investor and cryptocurrency consultant. ""People are angry.""Tesla did not respond to requests for comment about Musk's thoughts on bitcon, dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The law states that ""all economic agents shall accept bitcoin as a form of payment when it is offered by the purchaser of a good or service."" It also says that tax payments can now be made in bitcoin.Bukele, 39, is a right-wing populist who rose to power in 2019. He previously said that El Salvador would partner with digital finance company Strike to establish the infrastructure required to support the use of bitcoin as an official currency. Giving a currency legal tender status typically means that it can be used by borrowers to repay debts. It doesn't automatically mean that a person or business is required to accept the currency as payment for goods or services. In a tweet prior to the vote, Bukele said that using bitcoin as legal tender would promote financial inclusion, tourism, innovation and economic development. El Salvador is the smallest country in Central America, and while it was quick to contain the coronavirus pandemic, its economy was hard hit last year, according to the World Bank.The future of digital currenciesAlthough central banks around the world have reacted to bitcoin with fascination, they have been hesitant to embrace cryptocurrencies because of their extreme volatility. Bitcoin, for example, crashed by more than half its value earlier this year after rocketing to a record high above $60,000.

With this move, the ""access, knowledge, and the exploration of cryptocurrency has the potential to become mainstream in the UK,"" the company said in a statement.It's been a turbulent few months for cryptocurrency.

By the end of the day, it had appeared on Apple and Huawei platforms.Hundreds of people marched against bitcoin in various protests across the capital city, the Financial Times reported. The price of bitcoin started the day around $53,000 before plunging by as much as 19%, according to data from Coinbase. The digital currency has since recovered some losses to trade near $46,270.President Nayib Bukele, a right-wing populist who is the driving force behind the bitcoin initiative, took the dramatic price drop in his stride. ""Buying the dip,"" he quipped on Twitter. He also joined online crypto supporters in praising major companies such as McDonald's (MCD) for accepting bitcoin as payment.Supporters have argued that adopting bitcoin as legal tender will help Salvadorans avoid costly fees on remittances from abroad, which totaled nearly $6 billion last year — around a quarter of GDP. Bukele may succeed in ironing out the initial technical glitches, but the biggest risks from bitcoin will persist long into the future. El Salvador does not have a currency of its own, instead relying on the US dollar.

Earlier, it was down as much as 12%.Other cryptocurrencies are tumbling, too. Ethereum and dogecoin have each declined 4.4% and about 6%, respectively, in the past 24 hours.  The fall followed a major drop in US stocks on Monday, as Wall Street's fears turned to China. Investors have been uneasy over the deepening crisis of Evergrande, a massive Chinese property conglomerate that's at risk of defaulting.It was the worst performance since May for the S&P (SPX) and the Nasdaq (COMP), while the Dow (INDU) logged its worst day since July.  Experts have characterized Evergrande's struggles as a major test for Beijing, with some worrying about whether the company risks creating China's Lehman Brothers moment. While other analysts have said it's far from certain that Evergrande's crisis will become a similarly far-reaching event, the crisis has sent shockwaves across the world.The property firm, which is struggling to manage its $300 billion mountain of debt, was supposed to pay the interest on some of its bank loans Monday, according to Bloomberg. Evergrande did not respond to a request from CNN Business for comment about those payments. Interest on two of its bonds worth more than $100 million is also due later this week, according to Refinitiv. Shares of Evergrande fell 5.7% in Hong Kong on Tuesday, extending Monday's losses.Even though the company primarily serves mainland China, investors around the world are worried. The massive amount of money borrowed by Chinese companies has long been considered a looming threat to market stability.

BoudetteThree months after Tesla said it would begin accepting the cryptocurrency Bitcoin as payment, the electric carmaker has abruptly reversed course.In a message posted to Twitter on Wednesday, Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, said Tesla had suspended accepting Bitcoin because of concern about the energy consumed by computers crunching the calculations that underpin the currency.“Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at a great cost to the environment,” Mr. Musk wrote. “We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.”Earlier this year, Tesla announced that it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and Mr. Musk trumpeted the company’s plan to accept the currency. Tesla later sold about $300 million of its Bitcoin holdings, proceeds that padded its bottom line in the first quarter.“Tesla will not be selling any Bitcoin and we intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy,” Mr. Musk wrote on Wednesday, referring to the process through which new Bitcoin is created.The price of Bitcoin dipped after the announcement, according to Coindesk.As cryptocurrencies explode in value, the amount of energy used by the digital currencies is increasingly under scrutiny. Some estimates put the energy use of Bitcoin at more than the entire country of Argentina.“Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind, and so it’s not a great climate thing,” Bill Gates said in February.Mr. Musk also said on Wednesday that Tesla was “looking at other cryptocurrencies” that use a fraction of the energy consumed by Bitcoin.

The latest drop leaves the cryptocurrency little changed from where it began the year, erasing a large run-up in recent months.The decline comes as China intensifies its crackdown on Bitcoin. The Chinese government has long viewed cryptocurrencies as a threat to its control over capital flows in the country. Recent statements from top policymakers and articles in the official news media have signaled an increased focus on controlling financial risks, likely to ensure smooth sailing for the economy ahead of a major Communist Party political meeting next year.China banned domestic cryptocurrency exchanges years ago, but trading has continued on other platforms. And China has remained a major hub for cryptocurrency mining operations, in which vast computer farms compete to solve complex equations in return for Bitcoin. Now, though, all of that is coming under greater official scrutiny.In May, Chinese financial regulators issued a stark statement barring banks and payment companies from handling crypto-related business and reminding consumers about the dangers of virtual currencies. Since then, local authorities in several parts of China have shut down crypto mining operations.In recent days, processing activity on the Bitcoin network, known as the hashrate, a measure of the computing power devoted to processing the cryptocurrency, has dropped markedly.

Anyone can read what you share.By Oscar Lopez and Ephrat LivniMEXICO CITY — El Salvador on Tuesday became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, allowing the cryptocurrency to be used in any transaction, from buying a cup of coffee to paying taxes.The bold move, largely celebrated by the international bitcoin community, has found a more skeptical reception at home and in the traditional financial world, amid concerns that it could bring instability and unnecessary risk to the Central American country’s fragile economy.President Nayib Bukele, a tech-savvy millennial, has promoted the digital currency’s adoption, pitching it as a way of bringing more Salvadorans, about 70 percent of whom don’t have bank accounts, into the formal economy. Using the cryptocurrency would make it faster and cheaper to get remittances from abroad, he argues, and could free the indebted nation from the hold of the traditional global financial system.Making Bitcoin legal tender — alongside the dollar, which the country has relied on since 2001 — is also part of Mr. Bukele’s charm offensive toward crypto entrepreneurs, who often seem like his primary audience.The country learned of the plan when Mr. Bukele announced it, in English, at a Bitcoin conference in Miami. Days later, while congress voted to approve the measure, the president chatted with American crypto enthusiasts on a social media hangout.In El Salvador, many are viewing the move with confusion and distrust, afraid that the volatility inherent to using virtual tokens with no physical backing, which are apt to soar and crash in value, could be dangerous for the economy — and their own savings.“We really don’t know how that s",El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.

Musk also said Tesla would not sell its own bitcoin until the currency’s “miners” turned to greener sources of energy to power the computers needed to process transactions and create new coins.“We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,” Musk said in a statement. “Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.”In February, Musk announced that Tesla had invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin and said the company would start accepting bitcoin payments, setting off a flurry of criticism from environmental advocates concerned about the energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s value received a notable bump after Musk revealed Tesla’s investment.On Wednesday, the cryptocurrency market again reacted swiftly to Musk’s reversal.When he posted a statement on Twitter around 3:06 p.m. in California, the value of a bitcoin was about $54,600. Two hours later, it hit its low point for the day at $46,980, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com.

Human rights groups condemned those actions, and some have described him as a “millennial autocrat.”The former mayor of the nation’s capital, San Salvador, Bukele deployed populist rhetoric and social media savvy to fuel his meteoric ascent. Critics have said his embrace of bitcoin is a political stunt meant to burnish his reputation — especially online — and distract from international protest of his conduct.At the conference, Bukele framed the bitcoin move as forward-looking and utopian, saying El Salvador is “starting to design a country for the future” by looking for “the best examples of ideas from history and around the world.”“I believe bitcoin could be one of these ideas,” he",El Salvador's president says he is trying to make Bitcoin legal tender in his country.

Though long-term holders are typically better suited to weather the volatility of the cryptocurrency, the prolonged slump has erased most of the astronomical gains built up this year. And those who purchased near bitcoin’s all-time high of $64,000 have seen their investments cut by more than half.By late afternoon Eastern time, bitcoin was trading around $32,000, turning positive for the day.The slide and rebound followed reports that China has ramped up its crackdown of bitcoin miners in the country, part of a continuation of Beijing’s antagonistic approach to cryptocurrency. To reduce energy consumption in support of their climate goals, Chinese authorities have sent miners scattering.The networks on which digital currencies run require robust computing power to execute transactions and other purposes, such as generating a fresh supply of cryptocurrency. But those maneuvers require large amounts of energy, a long-standing concern of environmentalists and other critics.Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, said earlier this month that his all-electric vehicle company would return to accepting bitcoin as payment once it confirms that enough miners are using renewable energy to power their networks.While the pronouncement highlighted the great electricity demands of crypto operators, it also illustrated how Musk and other big personalities can influence the market.Dogecoin, the popular meme token that has been a window into the exuberance of the crypto market, sank more than 6 percent, to about 19 cents —  well off the high of 72 cents set last month, leading up to Musk",The most popular and valuable and valuable token fell more than 9 percent overnight.

The SEC declined comment.Herds of amateur investors on Reddit have long been supporters of Tesla and other hyper-volatile stocks, and their influence appears to be growing.“I don’t think this is a fad, it is a generational shift in how people think about investing their money,” said John Patrick Lee, ETF manager at VanEck.Related Coverage“A retail trader will not lean on Wall Street to manage their money and I definitely now see an antagonistic relationship between the old guard (Wall Street) and individual traders who are on the rise,” he said.As well as GameStop, BlackBerry, also favored on Wallstreetbets, advanced 4.9% and is up 185% this year. An earlier tweet by Musk sent Etsy up almost 9% before it reversed its gains.The surge in recent days - GameStop has increased more than seven-fold to $147.98 from $19 since Jan. 12 - has spurred concerns over bubbles in stocks that hedge funds and other speculative players had bet would fall in value.Trading in GameStop stock was halted for volatility nine times on Monday and five times on Tuesday.To some stock market professionals, the recent moves look symbolic of a stock market that may be overvalued at the end of a year dominated by floods of fiscal and monetary stimulus to ease the coronavirus crisis.The benchmark S&P 500 has gained more than 70% from lows last March caused by the coronavirus pandemic.“This is hardly an environment where informed investors are transacting to establish price discovery,” said Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.Venture capital investor Chamath Palihapitiya said in a tweet that he had bought $115 call options on GameStop on Tuesday morning after an exchange with Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian.Short sellers in GameStop are down $5 billion on a mark-to-market, net-of-financing basis in 2021, which included $876 million of losses early Tuesday, according to analytics firm S3 Partners.“GME shorts and longs are in a knockout battle being waged in the stock market as well as social media platforms,” wrote Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s managing director of predictive analytics.Another stock popular with Reddit investors, Virgin Galactic Holdings, surged 17%, and is now up 77% year to date.Much of the recent action among Reddit traders has centered around shares that have been heavily “shorted” by other market players - traditionally an area dominated by hedge funds.Shares in Evotec rallied 8% on Tuesday with three traders reporting that hedge fund Melvin Capital Management was closing its short positions after suffering losses on some bets.Melvin previously held a 6.2% short bet against Evotec, according to filings with the German regulator. The fund did not respond to requests for comment.Short sellers typically bet against stocks of companies that they view as outdated in their business models or otherwise overvalued.Noted short seller Andrew Left is as convinced as ever that GameStop is a dying business and its stock price will fall sharply. Left shorted the company’s stock when it traded around $40 a share and forecast publicly that it would tumble to $20 a share. He said on Tuesday that he was still short the stock.“Will it end badly? Sure.

GameStop shares fell on Thursday following the curbs, which drew calls for scrutiny from regulators and outrage from celebrities and politicians on both sides of the political aisle.Robinhood said late on Friday opening new positions in 50 securities including GameStop is currently allowed, but limited.Koss Corp was up 53%, but both the headphone maker and GameStop remained below peaks reached earlier this week.Hedge funds and other short sellers had a bruising week. GameStop short sellers have endured mark-to-market losses of $19.75 billion so far this year, according to S3 Partners. Even so, the stock remained highly shorted, with $11.2 billion short interest.Related CoverageSee more storiesThe SEC issued a rare joint statement from its acting chair and commissioners that said it was working closely with other regulators and stock exchanges “to protect investors and to identify and pursue potential wrongdoing” and would “closely review actions ... that may disadvantage investors” or hinder their ability to trade stocks.The showdown between small traders and professional short-sellers also drew scrutiny from lawmakers, the White House and the attorneys general of New York and Texas.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued 13 civil investigative demands, the civil equivalent of a subpoena, on Friday to Robinhood and others that put curbs on stock trading, calling it “shockingly unprecedented and wrong.”The battle added to uncertainty in equity markets that had looked ripe for a pullback. Some funds were forced to sell some of their best-performing stocks, including Apple Inc, to cover billions of dollars in losses on short positions.All three main indexes suffered their biggest weekly fall since the end of October on Friday, closing down around 2%.[.N]The surge in volatility has led to a huge increase in volume, totaling over 20 billion shares in each of the past two sessions across U.S. exchanges for the most active trading days on record going back to 2014, according to Refinitiv data.The “Reddit stocks” have accounted for as much as 7.6% of that volume, according to Piper Sandler analyst Rich Repetto.“The markets were vulnerable to a decline ... and this Reddit activity was the catalyst that sort of triggered the sell-off,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.GameStop marked a near 400% weekly gain, eclipsed by Koss’s 1,800% week. AMC Entertainment rose 54% on Friday, and was up 278% for the week, while Express added almost 28%.Virgin Galactic closed up 2.7%, Bed Bath & Beyond was up 5%, and American Airlines fell 5% after a rally the prior session. Since the start of the week, BlackBerry Ltd more than doubled to touch $36 on Wednesday before easing back to $19.96 on Friday. [.TO] Silver continued a blistering rally.While some companies swept up in the so-called “Reddit rebellion” have used the opportunity to raise capital, most have said little about the volatility in their shares. GameStop did not reply to multiple requests for comment. AMC, BlackBerry and Koss did not immediately respond to requests for comment.For a full list of Reuters stories about the GameStop phenomenon, please see:Restrictions imposed on Thursday were driven by the high concentration of risk in hot stocks and by increased clearinghouse capital and deposit requirements, Piper Jaffrey said.While Robinhood eased the curbs on Friday, it was still not allowing purchases of fractional shares in GameStop and some other companies, meaning smaller investors must bet more to buy-in. The brokerage was also limiting the number of shares any one account could hold.London-based trading platform Freetrade disabled buy orders for U.S. stocks but will allow users to exit positions.While the battle could limit short-sellers’ influence on the market, analysts said, the fact remained that the prices of stocks will eventually fall if they are overvalued.“These moves ... can go a lot further than people can expect, but they end with a quick move back down,” said David Starr, vice president of quantitative analysis at Simpler Trading. “People race for the exi","GameStop shares rallied again on Friday, awarding retail investors the advantage of any wrongdoing in this week's roller-coaster trade.

Late Thursday, Robinhood said it will allow limited buying on Friday.“We’re done letting hedge fund billionaires treat the stock market like their personal playground, then taking their ball home as soon as they lose,” said U.S. Representative Ro Khanna, who noted that hedge funds were allowed to continue trading stocks while individual investors were handicapped by trading limits on Robinhood.Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republican Ted Cruz were among a growing number of lawmakers who agreed Congress needed more information.Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, tweeted the restriction was “unacceptable,” adding Congress needed to know more about the move “to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit.”Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, took to Twitter retweeting Ocasio-Cortez with rare words of agreement, writing “Fully agree.”Cruz told reporters that lawmakers needed answers “to why they halted the trading. ... it seems to favor a handful of rich influential players at the expense of ordinary citizens and ordinary traders.”White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki declined to comment on Robinhood’s actions.Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk backed Ocasio-Cortez’s criticism of Robinhood on Twitter responding “absolutely.”Senator Sherrod Brown, the incoming Banking committee, chair, said “People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they’re the ones getting hurt.”A Robinhood spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawmakers’ criticism.Republican Senators Mike Lee and Patrick Toomey also joined the critics of Robinhood as did Khanna, a Democrat.U.S. Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat, called the restriction “beyond absurd.”Tlaib urged on Twitter that Congress “have a hearing on Robinhood’s market manipulation.

The stock has risen about 140% this year, after paring most of the gains that sent short sellers scrambling to cover losing bets and saw the company hit a record high of $482.95.GameStop has also been targeted by shareholders pushing it to focus more on digital sales rather than its mall-based locations.New directors focused on this strategy have recently joined its board and the source said those additions had helped create more momentum for the CFO transition.GameStop said it has begun a search for a permanent CFO, adding that it would appoint Chief Accounting Officer Diana Jajeh as interim CFO if a permanent replacement was not found before Bell’s departure.Reporting by Subrat Patnaik, Ankit Ajmera and Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru, and Jessica DiNapoli in New York; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Jane Wardell",GameStop Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell to step down next month.

As chief customer officer, he had been in charge of marketing, customer loyalty and GameStop’s “omnichannel business,” according to the company’s website.GameStop last month also said Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell would step down.Since Cohen joined GameStop’s board, the 35-year-old entrepreneur has been obsessing about customer service, contacting customers late into the night to solicit feedback, pushing to upgrade the company’s website.Cohen also brought on board Kelli Durkin, who spearheaded initiatives at Chewy that included personal written notes to customers, as senior vice president of customer care.Cohen hopes to transform the brick-and-mortar retailer into an e-commerce firm that can take on big-box retailers such as Target Corp and Walmart Inc and technology firms such as Microsoft Corp and Sony Corp.GameStop was the main beneficiary of a surge driven by a pack of social media-centric amateur traders that cost some hedge fund short-sellers billions.Since labelled a “meme stock”, the company’s shares soared as much as 2500% from the start of January and are still up ten-fold despite trimming gains.Investors are closely watching its fourth quarter results expected today, where GameStop is expected to return to a sales growth after many quarters of decline.Reporting by Eva Mathews and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D’Silva and Christian Plumb",GameStop Corp said its chief customer officer Frank Hamlin will resign on March 31.

His one-word comment — ""Gamestonk!!"" — was all it took to cheer on the the popular Reddit page that's been generating most of the hype around the stock.That was the second Musk tweet in 24 hours to create a stir for an individual stock — Etsy shares spiked in premarket trading Tuesday following his declaration that he ""kinda"" loves the online craft market. GameStop is up more than 680% so far this year — an improbable spike led by investors congregating on the WallStreetBets subreddit. Those traders have essentially declared war on GameStop's short sellers — investors who have placed bets that a stock would go down. The more GameStop climbs, the more money the short sellers lose. The Reddit traders are also piling onto other struggling companies that short sellers tend to see as overvalued, including BlackBerry (BB), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Macy's (M) and AMC (AMC).","GameStop is up more than 92%, or about $148, a share.

La Monica, CNN BusinessUpdated 4:14 PM ET, Wed January 27, 2021 New York (CNN Business)Welcome to the Reddit market.A group on Reddit's Wall Street Bets board have been promoting a number of stocks, hoping to squeeze short sellers that have been betting against them.They're succeeding. Their best-known bet is GameStop (GME), which rose another 133% Wednesday after nearly doubling Tuesday. It has now soared about 1,700% this year. Today's target: AMC (AMC), the (very) struggling theater chain that just announced a nearly $1 billion lifeline to stay open.Shares of the new WSB plaything skyrocketed more than 230% Wednesday after members of the Reddit board and investors on online brokerage firm Robinhood were touting the stock and got #SaveAMC trending on Twitter. Both stocks had their trading occasionally halted for volatility Wednesday. And the dramatic spikes caused at least one top online broker, TD Ameritrade, to curb trading in the two companies.""In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have put in place several restrictions on some transactions in GameStop, AMC and other securities,"" said a spokesperson for TD Amerirtrade, which is no owned by Charles Schwab (SCHW). ""We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors,"" the TD Ameritrade spokesperson added. AMC is struggling financially -- just like GameStop -- and is a favorite stock of short sellers. AMC wasn't exactly a top performer before the pandemic, and the massive drop-off in theater attendance over the past 10 months sent it scrambling for cash. Last year, the company said it doubted its ability to stay in business.But AMC's CEO told CNN Business Tuesday he is now hopeful (after an influx of cash) that the company can ride out the pandemic until people are ready go back to theaters. That's a bold bet -- blockbusters like the new James Bond movie keep getting pushed back, and CNN parent company WarnerMedia pledged to release all of its Warner Bros. titles simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max.Similarly, GameStop may have been oversold and due for a comeback: Investors on social media had been arguing that GameStop was seriously undervalued and cheered earlier this month when the company added Chewy founder Ryan Cohen, who has been pushing a digital overhaul, to its board. Also, video games are a hot commodity in the stay-at-home era, particularly after the launches of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.But GameStop faces many of the same problems that other retailers face. It was struggling before the pandemic, as video games went digital and Amazon began eating into its market share. With malls dying across the world, those fundamentals aren't about to change -- and certainly haven't changed so dramatically in the past few days and weeks to send its stock soaring nearly 700%.That's why this Reddit saga isn't just about fundamentals.The reason GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry (BB) and a bunch of other stock picks from the WSB group are soaring is because the way people trade stocks has changed dramatically. No-fee apps like Robinhood democratize access to financial markets. Who needs high-paid Wall Street analysts when you can get stock tips for free on Reddit?Although the hive mind of WSB poses some real dangers of a bubble mentality, there's no arguing with their success. Short-sellers rushing in to hedge their bets and cover their positions are keeping Reddit's stocks soaring with no signs of stopping.Two questions remain: Who's next?

CNN,Gamestop,3,Everything you need to know about how a Reddit group blew up GameStop's stock,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/27/investing/gamestop-reddit-stock/index.html,"By Allison Morrow, CNN BusinessUpdated 6:40 AM ET, Thu January 28, 2021 New York (CNN Business)The GameStop frenzy on Wall Street has investors, and much of the internet, enraptured — not unlike a good horror movie. Everyone knows doom is just around the corner for some key players; a lucky few will emerge stronger; and the monster might be subdued but will ultimately come back for a sequel. The cast of charactersWho's the monster and who's the hero, in this case, depends entirely on your perspective. On one side you have a band of mostly young day traders who coordinate on Reddit to drive up the share price of struggling companies, including GameStop (GME), but also BlackBerry (BB), Macy's (M) and AMC (AMC). At least one Reddit user posted that he'd paid off thousands of dollars in student loans with his GameStop gains. On the other you have hedge funds and short-sellers — those who've placed bets that a company's stock will crash. These are Wall Street elite, the sort of investors millions of people rely on to make the smart decisions that boost their portfolios. But they're detested by many Millennials and Gen Zers for creating a house-of-cards financial system that led to the 2008 crisis. We're now, potentially, at the climax of this movie: GameStop is up more than 1,700% since the start of January. Some trading platforms, including TD Ameritrade and Robinhood, are restricting trades on AMC and GameStop. The SEC and the White House on Wednesday both said they were monitoring the situation. Here's the background you need to know.  Why GameStop?The popular Reddit page WallStreetBets is fond of targeting short-sellers. If you've ever played craps, these are the guys betting against the table, and their tactics, while often lucrative, have burnished their reputation as bloodsuckers and other, unpublishable, names. (More on that later.)It's not hard to understand why someone would short GameStop, however. The company is expected to lose money this year and next. Sales growth is sluggish because gamers no longer need to go to the mall to buy games or consoles. That said, some investors have argued that GameStop was seriously undervalued, especially when video games have become staples of the stay-at-home pandemic era. The GameStop stock surge began for a legitimate reason: The company announced on January 11 it had added three new directors to its board, including Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen. Investors liked that Cohen brought digital experience to the table, something the largely brick-and-mortar GameStop desperately needs, as video games go digital and malls continue their unending slump into irrelevance.GameStop's stock rose a little less than 13% that day. But this wasn't a normal, momentary stock surge. Two days later, it rose 57%. Then 27%. The next week, it surged 10% twice and 51% another day. This week, it rose another 18% then 93% and more than doubled today.The reason is two-fold, both of which are far removed from anything related to the company's fundamental strength: Investors following the Reddit group bought a ton of GameStop options, and short-sellers had to buy shares to cover their losing bids.On Wednesday, while all three major stock indexes tumbled, GameStop finished up a mind-boggling 134%. For perspective: One year ago, a single share cost about $4. It's now $200.Not just GameStopA similar story was playing out with shares of AMC, the movie theater chain that's been devastated by the pandemic. Shares of the new WSB plaything were up more than 200% Wednesday after members of the Reddit board and investors on Robinhood were touting the stock. The hashtag #SaveAMC was trending on Twitter.Both AMC and GameStop spiked so rapidly Wednesday they triggered automatic halts designed to protect against volatility. Why is this happening now?The way people trade stocks has been upended by the rise of no-fee apps like Robinhood. That technology has democratized investing, giving armchair investors far removed from traditional banks free access to sophisticated trading instruments, like options. You could pay an analyst to tell you what stocks to buy, or you could create a Reddit account and follow forums like WallStreetBets. Millions of young people are opting for the latter, which is partly why the sudden surges in GameStop and AMC have caught Wall Street veterans by surprise. What's an option?Options are bets investors place on a stock, allowing them to buy (a ""call"" option) or sell (a ""put"" option) at a particular price. That allows people to wager on whether a stock will rise or fall.Investors can place relatively inexpensive options bets and sell those options as they rise in value when the stock price gets closer to their wager. Although buying and selling options isn't the same as buying and selling stocks, big options volumes can drive a stock up or down, typically because options traders buy or sell the stock itself as a hedge.In the case of GameStop and other stocks targeted by WSB, traders","GameStop is up more than 1,700% since the start of January.

American warned that its first-quarter loss will likely be worse than its fourth-quarter loss.But shares soared pre-market following the report, at one point rising 87% before settling back down. Shares of American were up about 15% in early trading. Once again the rise appeared to be driven by posts on Reddit by some who hoped to drive up the price and put a squeeze on investors who bet against it by shorting it. ""AAL flying to moon?"" wrote one investor. ""Let's see if we are going to get some tasty juice out of a squeeze.""Those investors have recently driven up the price of shares of GameStop (GME), another troubled money losing company. According to S3 Partners, about 19% of American shares are controlled by shorts. No other US airline has as much as 5% of its shares held by shorts.American CEO Doug Parker declined to comment on the stock move in his call with analysts and media Thursday: ""As a rule, we don't speculate on the day-to-day movements of our share price. We'll stick to that rule today.""From CNN Business' Allison MorrowShort sellers are investors who bet that a stock is going to fall. They borrow shares to sell on the market with the promise to buy back those shares at a later date. If they win the bet, they sold high and bought low, and they walk away with money in the bank.If they lose the bet and the stock goes higher, they have to buy back the stock at more than the price they originally sold it for -- and when a bunch of people are scrambling to cover their losses and get out, it can shoot the price even higher, called a short squeeze.Short interest in GameStop surged toward the end of the year, as investors bet against the company's earnings potential. With a mega short squeeze taking place, short sellers began to hedge their bets, buying more stock to make up for their mounting losses.From CNN Business' Matt EganRobinhood imposed restrictions Thursday that prevent users of the free-trading app from buying shares of GameStop, AMC and other stocks targeted by Reddit traders.Citing “recent volatility,” Robinhood said it will only allow users to close out their positions in those stocks, which include Best Buy, Bed Bath & Beyond, Express and Nokia. Following the move by Robinhood, shares of GameStop (GME) lost all of their premarket gains and turned sharply negative.Robinhood said that it also raised margin requirements for certain securities, a move that can protect the startup from losing money should some of these stocks plunge.“We’re committed to helping our customers navigate this uncertainty,” the company said in a statement. “We fundamentally believe that everyone should have access to financial markets.”From CNN Business' Anneken TappeUS stocks opened in the green Thursday amid various economic reports: The US economy contracted by 3.5% last year, making it the nation’s worst year since 1946 and the first decline since the financial crisis.Meanwhile, a lower-than-expected number of Americans filed claims for unemployment benefits last week.While investors are digesting economic reports and earnings season roars on, GameStop (GME) continues to be in focus after various brokers have restricted trading in the company. GameStop plunged more than 20% at the opening bell.From CNN Business' Paul R. La MonicaGameStop (GME) shares are now up nearly 2,500% this year -- surging from just under $20 at the end of the year to a current price of about $460. It's largely because of an army of investors who are buying the stock to hurt hedge funds that have bet against GameStop.The phenomenon is called a short squeeze. An investor who thinks a stock will fall borrows the shares and sells them, with the hopes of buying them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference before paying back the loan.The problem is that a short seller can get into a hole if the stock they borrowed keeps climbing. The losses, in theory, are infinite. So that creates another buying frenzy as short sellers rush to buy back the stock before it moves even higher.From CNN Business' Allison MorrowThe way people trade stocks has been upended by the rise of no-fee apps like Robinhood.

The company imposed the stock-trading restrictions Thursday citing ""recent volatility.""  The company said in a blog post it will only allow users to close out their positions in those stocks, which include GameStop (GME), AMC (AMC), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), and Nokia (NOK). Following the decision Thursday, shares of GameStop fluctuated wildly.The lawsuit claims Robinhood's decision deprived retail investors of potential gains they could have made by buying when the stock was low and selling when its price rose.GameStop's stock has soared since January 11 after it hired several new board members that investors believed could help the stock boost its digital sales. Reddit's WallStreetBets group began promoting the stock, sending it soaring more than 1,000% over the past several weeks. The stock's surge forced short-sellers who were betting against the stock to buy shares to hedge their positions, sending the stock soaring even higher.  Many day traders took advantage of Robinhood's free trades, placing bets on GameStop and other stocks the Reddit group promoted. But those customers are playing a dangerous game. The companies' fundamentals don't support such elevated stock prices, and the bubble could burst, wiping out the traders who had placed big bets on GameStop and the like.""We're committed to helping our customers navigate this uncertainty,"" the company said in a statement. ""We fundamentally believe that everyone should have access to financial markets.""Robinhood published another blog post Thursday afternoon saying it would ""allow limited buys of these"" stocks starting Friday.Redditors band togetherFollowing Robinhood's decision earlier Thursday morning, Redditors stood up a new forum, r/ClassActionRobinHood, to coordinate efforts for a lawsuit.

The firm's homepage currently has a prompt titled, ""Are you a Robinhood user who has suffered losses?"" along with a way for people to submit information. The firm has collected information from more than 6,000 people as it investigates Robinhood, attorney Philip Vujanov told CNN.""This is pretty unprecedented, I've never heard of another scenario like this,"" Vujanov told CNN in a phone interview. ""There's going to be a lot of people left holding the bag.""Vujanov specifically called Robinhood's actions today ""disingenuous"" while citing a tweet from Robinhood's official Twitter account in March 2016 that stated, ""Let the people trade.""""Now, all of a sudden, they are changing their position,"" Vujanov said regarding Robinhood.One avid Wallstreetbets user dismayed over Robinhood's decision was Christopher Kardatzke, 21, a recent college graduate who, along with his brother, have developed free financial software  used by Redditors to guide their investment strategy.""It seems a bit silly. The people of r/wallstreetbets were buying up GameStop and playing a game of Jenga, but it's the same game that hedge funds have been playing for decades and decades,"" Kardatzke said.

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.What's happening: Stock in the left-for-dead video game retailer shot up an astonishing 135% to $347.51 on Wednesday, bringing gains since the start of January to 1,745%. In the battle between day traders coordinating on Reddit and legacy hedge funds betting GameStop shares will crash, the rag-tag internet crew is winning the day — at least for now.It's not just about GameStop (GME) anymore. Shares of AMC Entertainment (AMC), Nokia (NOK), Tootsie Roll Industries (TR) and the shell of a bankrupt Blockbuster also soared Wednesday as emboldened small investors looked further afield.Earlier this week, I wrote about how the spectacle has grabbed Wall Street's attention, forcing the old guard to reckon with how the democratization of investing through no-fee trading platforms like Robinhood is affecting market dynamics. There's plenty more to be said on that front. But for now, there's one big question: Just how does this episode end?Shares of companies like GameStop and AMC Entertainment remain extremely volatile in premarket trading, leaving the immediate fate of the rally unclear. As of 7:35 a.m. ET, GameStop shares were up 37% to $475.Outside of the United States, where stock in popular hedge-fund targets like Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield had also shot up, there were signs Thursday morning of retrenchment. Shares of the European shopping center owner shed almost 2% in Amsterdam on Thursday after gaining nearly 20% the previous session.For the hedge funds and short sellers at the center of the melee, though, the damage is done. Melvin Capital closed out its position in GameStop this week after taking a huge loss, CNBC reports. Andrew Left of Citron Research said in a YouTube video posted Wednesday that he covered most of his GameStop shorts at ""a loss of 100%.""Watch this space: So far, many on Wall Street are viewing the GameStop saga as a somewhat isolated event. But there are some concerns that damaged Wall Street money managers may need to sell other stocks they'd been planning to hold for the long-term — say in Apple, or Target — in order to cover losses. That could ripple through the broader market, which on Wednesday had its worst day since October thanks to concerns about Covid-19 vaccination efforts and the economy. It's evident that investors are on edge. The VIX, a measure of stock market volatility, shot up nearly 62% on Wednesday, its third biggest one-day leap on records dating back to 2001. It retreated on Thursday but remains elevated.Talk about whether regulators need to step in and limit this kind of behavior is also increasing — though for the folks at the Securities and Exchange Commission, it's not a clear-cut case.

Sales of iPhones grew more than 17% year-over-year to nearly $65.6 billion, feeding hopes that the company's earnings will be supercharged in 2021 by a flood of people rushing to upgrade their devices.Facebook, meanwhile, said revenue rose 33% to roughly $28 billion during the quarter, showing the durability of its core advertising business despite the pandemic. When combining Facebook's various apps, including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, the company reported 3.3 billion monthly active users, an increase of 14% year-over-year.Tesla told investors that it had notched its first full year as a profitable company, and vowed to increase sales growth by more than 50% in 2021.

Melvin, a major short-seller of GameStop, bet that the company's shares would drop. But, on January 11, GameStop announced new board members who could help it with digital sales. That set off a fury on Reddit, namely subreddit WallStreetBets, which catapulted GameStop's stock more than 1,600%.Hedge funds like Melvin with huge short positions in GameStop and other stocks targeted by WallStreetBets got burned. The Reddit group specifically targeted stocks that were heavily shorted. At one point, GameStop had more short interest than shares on the market.The Wall Street Journal first reported Melvin's losses.Melvin Capital was founded by Gabe Plotkin, and it started the year with roughly $12.5 billion in assets. It ended the month with more than $8 billion after receiving commitments from current investors for more capital in the final days of the month, the source said. Last week, Citadel, a hedge fund owned by billionaire Ken Griffin, provided the firm with a more-than-$2-billion bailout.""The fund's portfolio liquidity is strong,"" the source said. ""Use of leverage is at the lowest level since Melvin Capital's inception in 2014.""Melvin found itself at the heart of the GameStop saga after Robinhood suspended trading of the stock and several others Thursday. The move was followed by an onslaught of backlash from individual investors, such as those from Reddit, who felt Robinhood was giving into pressures from Wall Street and the requests of hedge fund managers.The frustration from Robinhood users was soon followed by a class-action lawsuit against the stock-trading app for its decision of restricting trading of stocks like GameStop.","Melvin Capital, a major Wall Street hedge fund, lost 53% in January.

The company announced Tuesday that Jim Bell, its executive vice president and CFO, will resign from his roles on March 26. GameStop (GME) has started searching for a new CFO ""with the capabilities and qualifications to help accelerate GameStop's transformation,"" it said, hinting at the company's efforts to shift its focus from physical to online retail. The announcement comes about a month after a trading frenzy fueled by the Reddit page WallStreetBets caused a massive spike — and, later, drop — in GameStop's stock. From the start of the year to January 27, when the stock closed at $347.51, shares gained nearly 1,915%. GameStop stock is now trading around $45, a big dip but still above where it started the year. The event provided massive publicity for GameStop, garnering the attention of everyone from the White House and Janet Yellen to billionaires like Mark Cuban and Elon Musk, not to mention the entire internet. It also raised questions about GameStop's future, as short sellers who believed the struggling retailer's fortunes would fall farther were pitted against retailer traders who believed the company was being undervalued. When asked by CNN Business about the reason for Bell's departure, a GameStop spokesperson said the company is ""not providing any further comments at this time concerning the announcement."" In a press release, GameStop said it ""thanks Mr. Bell for his significant contributions and leadership, including his efforts over the past year during the COVID-19 pandemic.""Bell became GameStop's CFO in June 2019. That year, the company's chief executive admitted GamesStop was in a ""tough place"" — it was suffering from falling sales and had plans to close around 200 stores. While the larger video gaming industry has been growing, physical games, one of GameStop's mainstays, have become less popular. Then the pandemic hit and things got a whole lot worse. In September, the company announced it planned to close between 400 and 450 stores globally by the end of the year, around 100 more than it had initially projected last March. And in the three months that ended October 31, the company's most recent reported quarter, it posted a net loss of $18.8 million. Still, some investors remain hopeful about the company's ability to reduce its reliance on sales in physical stores and transition to e-commerce. The founder of online pet store Chewy.com, Ryan Cohen, made a large investment in GameStop last year and now sits on its board, along with two former Chewy colleagues, and could help push the retailer into the digital age. If no permanent CFO replacement is found prior to Bell's exit, the company plans to appoint Chief Accounting Officer Diana Jajeh as interim CFO.","GameStop announced Tuesday that Jim Bell, its executive vice president and CFO, will resign.

Grindr shared users’ private details with, among other companies, MoPub, Twitter’s mobile advertising platform, which may in turn share data with more than 100 partners, according to the agency’s ruling.Tobias Judin, head of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s international department, said Grindr’s data-mining practices not only violated European privacy rights but also could have put users at serious risk in countries, like Qatar and Pakistan, where consensual same-sex sexual acts are illegal.“If someone finds out that they are gay and knows their movements, they may be harmed,” Mr. Judin said. “We’re trying to make these apps and services understand that this approach — not informing users, not gaining a valid consent to share their data — is completely unacceptable.”The fine comes one year after European nonprofit groups lodged complaints against Grindr and its advertising partners with data protection regulators. In tests last January, The New York Times found that the Android version of the Grindr app was sharing location information that was so precise, it pinpointed reporters on the side of the building they were sitting on. In April, Grindr revamped its user consent process.In a statement, a spokesperson for Grindr said the company had obtained “valid legal consent from all” of its users in Europe on multiple occasions and was confident that its “approach to user privacy is first in class” among social apps.The statement added: “We continually enhance our privacy practices in consideration of evolving privacy laws and regulations, and look forward to entering into a productive dialogue with the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.”The company has until Feb. 15 to comment on the ruling before it is final. The Norwegian agency said it was investigating whether the ad companies that received users’ details from Grindr had also violated European data protection law.”Privacy experts said the ruling would have wide repercussions beyond dating apps.“This not only sets limits for Grindr,” said Finn Myrstad, the director of digital policy for the Norwegian Consumer Council, one of the groups that lodged the complaints, “but establishes strict legal requirements on a whole industry that profits from collecting and sharing information about our preferences, location, purchases, physical and mental health, sexual orientation and political views.”— Natasha Singer and Aaron Krolik Budweiser, the beer giant whose commercials featuring Clydesdale horses, croaking frogs and winsome puppies made it one of the most beloved Super Bowl advertisers, is opting out of the game-time broadcast this year for the first time in 37 years to focus on raising awareness for the Covid-19 vaccine.Budweiser, an Anheuser-Busch company, said Monday that it would donate portions of its advertising budget this year to the Ad Council, a nonprofit marketing group at the helm of a $50 million ad blitz to fight coronavirus vaccine skepticism. Instead of debuting a splashy big-game commercial, as Super Bowl advertisers often do in the weeks leading up to the Feb. 7 match, the beer company released its 90-second online vaccination ad, titled “Bigger Picture.” (Anheuser-Busch will still feature prominently during the game, with ads for several of its other beer brands.)Other Super Bowl stalwarts, including Coca-Cola, Hyundai and Pepsi, will also be missing onscreen. As the pandemic disrupted the sports industry, many companies hesitated to pay CBS roughly $5.5 million for a 30-second slot during a game that some worried could be delayed or even canceled.In the Budweiser Covid-19 vaccination ad, the actress Rashida Jones urges viewers to “turn our strength into hope” while the melody of “Lean on Me” plays as inspirational images from the pandemic are shown.

Anyone can read what you share.By Andrew Ross Sorkin, Jason Karaian, Michael J. de la Merced, Lauren Hirsch and Ephrat LivniWhy is Wall Street obsessed with GameStop, the video game chain that until recently was known for middling performance? The company’s stock has soared to scarcely believable levels — its market cap as of yesterday was $10 billion, and its shares briefly doubled in premarket trading today — thanks to an army of small traders spurred on by a Reddit message board.What’s happening: Traders on the Reddit message board, WallStreetBets, a community known for irreverent market discussions, made GameStock their cause du jour and rushed to buy out-of-the-money GameStop options. (A sample comment on the board: “PUT YOUR LIFTOFF DIAPERS ON ITS ABOUT TO START.”) Both Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya also egged on the crowd via Twitter. The frenzy has forced market makers who sold the options to buy the underlying shares to hedge their risk. As more traders snap up options, the brokers have to buy up more shares. That’s driving the astounding rise in the company’s stock price, which began the year at $19 and at the time of writing was around $230.If you want to sound smart, traders call this phenomenon a “gamma squeeze.” And if this sounds familiar, it’s because SoftBank’s mass buying of tech stock options last year — earning it the moniker of the “Nasdaq whale” — worked in a similar way. (Extra credit: “Delta hedging” is also a factor in all of this.)Includes after-hours trading, as of 6:30 a.m. Eastern on Jan. 27Source: FactSetThe New York TimesThe Reddit jockeys have already toppled a bigwig. Gabe Plotkin, the hedge fund trader whose Melvin Capital was shorting GameStop — and who recently raised a $2.75 billion bailout from Citadel and his former boss, Steve Cohen, amid the short squeeze — confirmed to CNBC this morning that he was throwing in the towel and had exited his position. Though Mr. Plotkin’s other short bets appear to be suffering, possibly because they are being targeted by traders (Melvin and Mr. Plotkin are often pilloried on the message boards), he said that his firm had plenty of capital.A big worry is that this has become a short-squeeze revolt. Short-sellers were down $91 billion for the month through yesterday, according to data from S3. (Such investors have lost $5 billion on GameStop alone.) While much of that was because of the overall rise in stocks, shares in other heavily shorted companies, like the headphone maker Koss, are up big. “I believe there is a systemic targeting of highly shorted stocks,” said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.Is there something else at play? Commentators are split: Matt Levine of Bloomberg Opinion reckons that this might all be a game to participants, while his colleague John Authers sees a populist uprising against establishment institutionsIn any case, this is “an enforcement nightmare,” the Duke law professor James Cox told Bloomberg. Officials at the S.E.C. and elsewhere are closely watching internet chat rooms for signs of potential market manipulation, though they can do only so much without clear signs of fraud. If a big group of traders simply decides to buy options on a stock at the same time, out in the open, for the heck of it, proving malfeasance may be difficult. Still, “it suggests that there is something systemically wrong with the options trading on this stock,” William Galvin, Massachusetts’ securities regulator, told Barron’s, referring to the GameStop craze.While most attention is on WallStreetBets, we hear that some traders are starting to use encrypted messaging services — which are harder to monitor — to discuss new investment strategies.A growing battle over Covid-19 vaccine supplies.

These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus. A resurgence in recent months in Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths is causing great hardship for millions of Americans, and is weighing on economic activity and job creation. Following a sharp rebound in economic activity last summer, the pace of the recovery has moderated in recent months, with the weakness concentrated in the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing. The overall recovery and economic activity since last spring is due in part to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which have provided essential support to many families and individuals. The recently enacted Coronavirus Response and Relief Act will provide additional support. Overall, economic activity remains below its level before the pandemic, and the path ahead remains highly uncertain. While we should not underestimate the challenges we currently face, several developments point to an improved outlook for later this year. Sufficiently widespread vaccinations would enable us to put the pandemic behind us, and return to more normal economic activities. In the meantime, continued observance of social distancing measures and wearing masks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible. The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.Wall Street suffered its sharpest daily decline in months on Wednesday as investors awaited a number of earnings reports from large technology companies and as the Federal Reserve issued a glum assessment of the economy.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indexes fell 2.6 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2 percent.The losses continued in the Asia-Pacific region in early trading on Thursday, though to a lesser extent, suggesting the losses could ease with the new day. Major indexes in Japan, China and Hong Kong were down more than 1 percent. Futures markets were suggesting Wall Street would open higher later on Thursday.After the S&P 500 rallied more than 16 percent in 2020, hitting record after record despite the economic damage caused by the pandemic, investors have grown concerned that financial markets have become detached from reality. And the sell-off came amid a speculative frenzy in some corners of the market that drove up shares of some mostly small, struggling companies.Though the trading that grabbed Wall Street’s attention this week is only in a handful of stocks — including GameStop and AMC Entertainment — the level of speculation is reminiscent of trading during the dot-com bubble two decades ago. On Wednesday alone, GameStop rose 130 percent and AMC surged 300 percent.Those gains, though, stood in stark contrast to a sell-off in the rest of the market. The S&P 500’s drop was its worst daily decline since late October.Some market watchers said the two could be connected. The spiking shares are wreaking havoc for hedge funds and other large investors that had bet against companies like GameStop, which is expected to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020, and AMC, which is struggling as the pandemic keeps moviegoers home. To shore up their finances those investors may have to sell large capitalization stocks.On Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve said it saw economic activity in the United States moderating, “with weakness concentrated in the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic.”“The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook,” the Fed said in a statement.

NYT,Gamestop,4,4 Things to Know About the GameStop Insanity,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/business/gamestop-stock-market.html,"AdvertisementSupported byIt has been a weird time in the stock market, where a video game retailer has suddenly become the center of attention.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Matt PhillipsThe internet and stock market are aflame over GameStop, the video game retailer whose stock is suddenly the darling of day traders who are putting the squeeze on Wall Street’s big players.The stakes are enormous: The surge in trading drove GameStop’s value up by more than $10 billion on Wednesday alone. On Thursday, as several trading platforms temporarily placed restrictions on the stock, the shares slid 44 percent, only to soar again on Friday after the trading restrictions were eased.Exactly why GameStop’s value — on paper, at least — has rocketed to stratospheric levels has to do with a mix of traditional investing, rampant enthusiasm, stock market mechanics and the belief that anyone with a Robinhood account can meme a fortune into existence.It’s called a short squeeze, and it involves investors betting on which way a stock will go — up or down. These bets are placed by buying the shares themselves, or stock options, which we’ll grossly oversimplify here.Investors who bet against a stock are called “shorts.” In GameStop’s case, the shorts include at least two big hedge funds.Shorting a stock essentially means borrowing shares from a broker and selling them, with the agreement you’ll return the shares later. When the price falls, you buy back the shares and pocket the difference. But shorting a stock is risky — if the price rises, you can lose big.Sometimes you just make a bad bet. But you can also lose if someone tries to push up the price by buying lots of shares, even though the company isn’t doing anything different.This is the squeeze.Shorts have to close their position — that is, buy up the shares they owe their brokers and return them. This demand kicks the stock higher, and a short who acts too late could be ruined.Usually, these kinds of standoffs involve sophisticated Wall Street investors, for example when Bill Ackman squared off against two other billionaires — Daniel S. Loeb and Carl C. Icahn — over the dietary supplement maker Herbalife.The amateurs started driving up the price.Over the past year, armchair traders have surged into the market. Some smelled opportunity after stocks tumbled last spring, some were trying to scratch a gambling itch after sports leagues shut down, and for some it’s just a game — trying to ring up dollars instead of points. All this has been made easier by the free trades available through platforms like Robinhood and E-Trade.Some of these enthusiastic amateurs are buying shares of GameStop, but many are placing their own options bets, on the opposite side of the shorts.These bets involve contracts that give them the option to buy a stock at a certain price in the future. If the price rises, the trader can buy the stock at a bargain and sell it for a profit. (In practice, lots of traders just sell the options contract itself for a profit or loss instead of actually buying the shares, but this description suffices for our purposes.)The brokers who sell the options contracts have to provide the shares if the trader wants to exercise the option. To mitigate their risk, they buy some of the shares they’d need. Normally, this small amount of demand doesn’t do much to the price.But if enough traders bet big, the demand can push the stock up. If it goes high enough, the brokers who would be on the hook have to buy more shares, lest they get stuck having to buy a lot of expensive shares all at once.That increases demand, which increases the stock’s price. Which means the brokers have to buy more shares, which means … you get the idea.You can put some of the blame on Reddit’s Wall Street Bets forum, one of the weirder places on the internet. Wall Street Bets, or WSB, is where armchair traders gather to share memes, commiserate over losses and share more memes. But they also trade tips and analysis that can go on for pages. GameStop’s shares started to rise late last year, after the founder of the pet-supply site Chewy bought a stake in the company and got a spot on its board. Slowly, the company gained the attention of WSB and traders who frequent the gamer-friendly social media service Discord.The traders’ motivations vary widely. Some reason that GameStop’s shares are a good value. Others are just riding the wave. And others want to squeeze Melvin Capital, a hedge fund that was shorting GameStop. They’re the ones quoting Heath Ledger’s Joker character from “The Dark Knight”: “It’s not about money; it’s about sending a message.”But the aggressive maneuvers against the shorts aren’t necessarily limited to the amateurs. Wall Street’s big players know a good opportunity when they see it.Nobody knows.On Thursday, Robinhood, Interactive Brokers and others placed more restrictions on trading of GameStop an",The surge in trading drove GameStops value up by more than $10 billion on Wednesday alone.

We’ll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed,” Robinhood said in blog post on Thursday afternoon, as it explained why it had put limits on trading — like allowing its users only to sell shares — earlier in the day.“To be clear, this was a risk-management decision, and was not made on the direction of the market makers we route to,” the company said, referring to the large trading firms who pay Robinhood for the app’s business.Other brokerage firms have also limited trading of some of the same stocks.The run on GameStop this month — the stock had surged 1,700 percent through Wednesday, giving the company an astonishing market valuation of $24 billion — means it has become detached from the factors that traditionally help establish a company’s value to investors, like growth potential or profits.But the traders who piled in were part of a frenzy that originated on a Reddit message board, WallStreetBets, a community known for irreverent market discussions, and on messaging platforms like Discord.Egged on by the message boards, these traders had rushed to buy options contracts that would profit from a rise in the share price. That trading can create a feedback loop that drives the underlying share prices higher, as brokerage firms that sell the options have to buy shares as a hedge.That spike has hit hedge funds that had been betting against the stock. Those funds have closed out the so-called short positions at sometimes big losses.

The decision quickly drew fire.Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, called Robinhood’s move “unacceptable.”“We now need to know more about Robinhood’s decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit,” she wrote on Twitter. “As a member of the Financial Services Committee, I’d support a hearing if necessary.”Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who often is a foil of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and who helped lead the push against certification of the presidential election results, replied: “Fully agree.”Customers flooded Google’s Play Store with angry, one-star reviews about the restrictions, tanking its average rating to 1 star out of 5.“Manipulating the market in favour of Wall St. Completely undemocratic, the exact opposite of their motto,” wrote one reviewer. “Well, steal from the rich and give to the poor, unless you try to take from the rich directly, in which case the app won’t work anymore.

The resurgent pandemic certainly wasn’t doing it. Even an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol wasn’t alarming enough to end the rally.GameStop, though?On Friday, the S&P 500 fell more than 1.9 percent, capping a stretch of volatile trading that left the index down more than 3 percent for the week — its worst week since late October.Data delayed at least 15 minutesSource: FactSetBy: Ella KoezeThe selling came as Wall Street was consumed by the antics of a group of day traders who have been bidding up a handful of stocks — notably the ailing video game retailer GameStop — and forcing losses on big hedge funds.The traders appear to be mostly small investors who are focused only on a handful of stocks. But they have emerged as a new risk factor for large firms that had bet against those companies with what are known as short sales. Short sellers lose money when a company’s shares rise, and the losses are potentially limitless.GameStop’s shares gained 400 percent this week and over 1,600 percent this month. Short sellers who had bet against the stock are facing losses of as much as $19 billion in January, according to estimates from Ortex, a market data firm. Another target, AMC Entertainment, gained about 280 percent this week.For the rest of Wall Street, the worry is that the hedge funds will have to sell shares of other companies to cover their losses on GameStop and AMC — “forced liquidation.” That selling was a factor in the stock market’s 2.6 percent drop on Wednesday, the S&P 500’s worst daily decline in three months, Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.It isn’t just GameStop that’s giving investors a reason to sell. They’re also concerned about the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine as countries begin to clamp down on supplies or warn of shortages. On Friday, the European Union announced plans to effectively halt any attempt by AstraZeneca to move vaccine doses manufactured in the bloc to other countries unless it first meets its supply obligations to the bloc’s 27 member states. Earlier in the week, Spain said it would have to partly suspend immunizations for lack of doses.The trading Friday reflected some of these concerns. Shares of companies that are sensitive to concerns about the pandemic — including Norwegian Cruise Line, Delta Air Lines and the shopping mall owner Kimco Realty — were among the worst performers on the S&P 500.But the conversation of the week focused on GameStop. And although the Securities and Exchange Commission and several lawmakers have said they’re watching the situation, it’s not yet clear how it will be addressed.“The battle over GameStop is far from over, but there have been huge casualties,” Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at the trading firm OANDA, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. “A solution for this entire market dislocation will take time, and that could suggest this insane trading will continue a little while longer.”The new focus on the market’s disconnect from fundamentals has come after stocks rallied more than 16 percent in 2020 despite the decimation of the economy and the human toll of the coronavirus pandemic. Many investors were already starting to raise concerns about the potential that financial markets had risen far too quickly after the Federal Reserve and lawmakers in Washington took unprecedented steps to shore up the economy and financial markets and as investors anticipated even more spending under a unified Democratic government.To some investors, the week’s turmoil served only as a distraction from those positives. Even as stocks fell this week, several large companies, including Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, reported profit and sales growth. The selling Friday came even after Johnson & Johnson said that its one-dose coronavirus vaccine provided strong protection against Covid-19.Mr. Haefele of UBS said he expected the “attention will likely shift back to earnings, stimulus, and the vaccine rollout,” and that when it does, stock markets will return to their gains.— Mohammed Hadi and Eshe Nelson The federal occupational safety agency on Friday posted new guidance for employers on reducing the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace, just over one week after President Biden signed an executive order directing it to do so.The move by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Labor Department, includes on","On Friday, the S&P 500 fell more than 1.9 percent, capping a stretch of volatile trading that left the index down more",Next story will be about people who shorted the shares at 400 dollars plus and make money when GME returns to earth,"Remember the old gambling adage, don’t bet against the house the house always wins..this is not investing it’s gambling",Positive Trust,Negative Anger Disgust,GameStops stocks went high again after Robinhood removed trading restrictions.

So far, he’s made over $800.Jude Folmar, a 19-year-old college student in Dallas, said he’s been trading stocks since he was 13 under a custodial account his great-aunt helped him set up. He’s earned over $22,000.And Liam Gavaghan, a 21-year-old university student in Kingston, Ontario, started trading about six weeks ago. He now spends hours scanning Reddit message boards focused on finance and talking to his friends about potential trades in a Discord voice chat room. He has made more than $9,000 on an initial investment of roughly $1,900 — money that he received as part of Canada’s Covid-19 stimulus relief package.“It’s risky as hell,” Mr. Gavaghan said about trading stocks. “But holy cow, it’s almost like getting a high.” In the world of high-stakes finance, these three new entrants might have once been outliers. No longer.They are part of a legion of young people — primarily male — pouring into digital trading floors in recent years, raised on social media and eager to teach themselves about stocks and trade quickly using an array of apps catered to Generation Z. In just a few short weeks, this new cohort of retail investors has completely upended some of the most professional traders by coordinating over social media, forums and chat rooms to trade shares of GameStop, sending the stock price for the video game company skyrocketing while leaving a number of sophisticated short-sellers holding the bag.Their motivations run the gamut: Many are unapologetic, cash-seeking capitalists. Some consider themselves idealists, would-be 99 percenters who were too young to occupy Wall Street in the movement’s heyday. Some are nihilists who simply want to tear down a system they feel is rigged against them from the start. Then there are those kids just doing it “for the lulz.”What many of them have in common, though, is that they buy and sell equities regularly, right from their smartphones, while posting their gains, or “tendies,” to online forums, all out in the open for their peers to see. They often view the trading as a sort of video game, similar to chasing a new high score on a puzzle app or accumulating likes on an Instagram post.Their impact on the market has been nothing short of extraordinary. GameStop’s stock has seen violent swings, with daily percent increases jumping into the triple digits. Pressure on investors who had previously “shorted” the stock — a bet that the price would drop — nearly bankrupted at least one hedge fund. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, has made the group of Redditors his cause célèbre, cheering them on in a series of tweets this week. At the same time, numerous Wall Street analysts railed against the traders, arguing that they had made a mockery of the markets.The blowback against them has even made for strange bedfellows in Washington. Politicians on both sides of the aisle united briefly in their contempt for Wall Street’s response to the young traders.All the while, the band of misfit traders continued laughing — all the way to their digital banks.“I’m just sitting here on Reddit, looking at the numbers grow up and up and up,” Mr. Gavaghan said, marveling at the enormous gains the GameStop stock has made in the past few days. The young traders are propelled, and empowered, by technology. Companies like Robinhood, a trading app aimed specifically toward market newbies, advertise across social platforms, enticing young users with no transaction fees, immediate access to instant deposits and a fun, user-friendly interface. On Thursday, Robinhood said it was raising more than $1 billion to grapple with an extraordinarily high volume of trading.And they turn to online communities to talk stocks and strategies with one another, on platforms like Discord and Reddit, most notably on the forum r/WallStreetBets. The foul-mouthed, meme-heavy group debates stocks and discusses trades in a way that feels native to many high school and college students.Daniel Uribe, 21, a college senior in San Diego, said that he discovered WallStreetBets five months ago after a YouTuber he follows, named Big Boss, made a video about the group.“I wanted to be part of the excitement,” Mr. Uribe said. He figured he might be able to make some cash, too. “There’s a lot of stuff that the older generation doesn’t realize even exists. We have different ways of making money that they don’t understand.”WallStreetBets is by no means all young people. The demographics of the Reddit forum, which now has over six million people, are broad and encompass out-of-work boomers, earnest millennials and hyper-online children.

It didn’t say that it also entirely relies on Wall Street. This past week, the two realities collided.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Nathaniel Popper, Matt Phillips, Kate Kelly and Tara Siegel BernardThe online trading app Robinhood became a cultural phenomenon and a Silicon Valley darling with a promise to wrest the stock market away from Wall Street’s traditional gatekeepers and “let the people trade” — making it as easy to put millions of dollars at risk as it is to summon an Uber.This past week, in the middle of a market frenzy pitting amateur traders against hedge fund bigwigs, that veneer began to chip. As it turned out, Robinhood was at the mercy of the very industry it had vowed to upend.The frenzy morphed into a crisis when legions of armchair investors on Robinhood, who had been buying up options and shares of GameStop, a video game retailer, enlarged those bets and also began making big trades in other stocks, including AMC Entertainment.As the trading mania grew, the financial system’s risk reduction mechanisms — managed by obscure entities at the center of the stock market called clearinghouses — kicked in on Thursday, forcing Robinhood to find emergency cash to continue to be able to trade. It had to stop customers from buying a number of heavily traded stocks and draw on a more than $500 million bank line of credit. On Thursday night, the company also took an emergency infusion of more than $1 billion from its existing investors.A high-flying start-up suddenly looked a lot like an overwhelmed, creaky company.“From a marketing standpoint they position themselves as new, innovative, cool,” said Peter Weiler, the co-chief executive of the brokerage and trading firm Abel Noser. “What I think everyone is missing is, when you peel the onion back they are just a heavily regulated business.”Robinhood’s distress follows a familiar narrative: A Silicon Valley company that promised to disrupt an industry ends up being overcome by the forces it unleashed and has to be reined in by regulators, or in this case, the industry it promised to change. Its arc is not all that different from Facebook and Google, which changed the ways in which billions of people socialize and search for information, but are now caught in the cross hairs of lawmakers and an angry public.“They were trying to change the rules of the road without understanding how the road was paved and without any respect for the existing guard rails,” said Chris Nagy, a former trading executive at TD Ameritrade and the co-founder of the Healthy Markets Association, a nonprofit that seeks to educate market participants. “It ended up creating risk for their customers and systemic risk for the market more broadly.”The fiasco will almost certainly have consequences for the company. The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday that it would closely review any actions that may “disadvantage investors or otherwise unduly inhibit their ability to trade certain securities.” Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle called for hearings over complaints that customers were shut out of trades.After Robinhood limited some trading on Thursday and the price of the stock plunged, furious users flooded online app stores with vitriolic reviews, with some accusing Robinhood of doing the bidding of Wall Street. Others sued the company for the losses they sustained. Robinhood’s continuing vulnerability, even after raising $1 billion, became clear on Friday when it restricted trading in more than 50 stocks.“It was not because we wanted to stop people from buying these stocks,” Robinhood said in a blog post on Friday night. Rather, the start-up said, it restricted buying in volatile stocks so that it could “comfortably” meet deposit requirements imposed by its clearinghouses, which it noted had increased tenfold during the week.None of this seems to be slowing down its growth. Even as Robinhood’s actions angered existing customers, it was winning new ones. The app was downloaded more than 177,000 times on Thursday, twice the daily download rate over the previous week, according to Apptopia, a data provider, and it had 2.7 million daily active users on its mobile app that day, its highest ever. That’s more than its rivals — Schwab, TD Ameritrade, E*Trade, Fidelity and Webull — combined.Controversy is not new for Robinhood.The two Stanford classmates who created the company in 2013 said from the beginning that their focus was on “democratizing finance” by making trading available to anyone. To do so, the Menlo Park, Calif., company has repeatedly employed a classic Silicon Valley formula of user-friendly software, brash marketing and a disregard for existing rules and institutions.Online brokers had traditionally charged around $10 for every trade, but Robinhood said that customers of it",Robinhood pitched itself to investors as the antithesis of Wall Street's gatekeepers.

He portrayed himself as a one-person operation doing battle with wealthy hedge funds, some of which were shorting shares of GameStop and betting on its collapse.“The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,” Mr. Gill said in the statement, which his lawyer provided to the House Committee on Financial Services in advance of Thursday’s hearing into the speculative and aggressive trading last month in shares of GameStop. “I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and that my aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks checking out the channel.”He said he had shared his investment ideas online because he “had reached a level where I felt sharing them publicly could help others.”Mr. Gill described himself as an average guy who earned a modest income and was effectively out of work for two years before landing at MassMutual in April 2019. The statement skirted over how much money he had made trading shares of GameStop — though he said he had told his family at one point that “we were millionaires.” He also did not mention that Massachusetts securities regulators are investigating whether he violated any securities industry rules and regulations with his social media postings.On Tuesday, Mr. Gill and his former employer were named as defendants in a proposed class-action lawsuit that claimed he misled retail investors who bought shares of GameStop during its 1,700 percent rally only to suffer losses when the stock quickly gave back most of those gains. The lawsuit contends that MassMutual and its brokerage arm did not properly supervise Mr. Gill, who was an employee until a few weeks ago.Mr. Gill’s lawyer, William Taylor, declined to comment on the lawsuit. A spokeswoman for MassMutual said the company was reviewing the matter with Mr. Gill.Mr. Gill is one of a half-dozen witnesses scheduled to testify at the hearing, which will focus on the impact of short selling, social media and hedge funds on retail investors and market speculation.— Matthew Goldstein The winter storm that battered much of the United States over the holiday weekend continued to slow auto production across the Midwest on Wednesday.On Tuesday, several automakers suspended or shut down production at plants from Texas to Indiana as rolling blackouts, natural gas shortages and extreme weather made operating difficult.General Motors canceled day shifts on Wednesday at factories in Arlington, Texas, and Fort Wayne, Ind., but was back to normal schedules at its plants in Spring Hill, Tenn.; Wentzville, Mo.; and Bowling Green, Ky., a spokesman said.Toyota canceled early shifts at plants in Tupelo, Miss., and San Antonio, the company said.

Anyone can read what you share.By Sapna MaheshwariThe Gap brand, which has flailed in recent years as it struggled with an identity crisis, has a new idea for how to revive its fortunes: Kanye West.The retailer is teaming up with Mr. West and Yeezy, his fashion company, for a new clothing line called Yeezy Gap, which will be introduced in the first half of 2021, the companies said on Friday. Yeezy’s design studio, under Mr. West’s creative direction, plans to create “modern, elevated basics for men, women and kids at accessible price points.” Mr. West’s “design vision” will extend to how the line will be showcased in Gap’s stores and online.Gap is making a far bigger bet on Yeezy and Mr. West, a celebrity, creative entrepreneur, rapper and designer, than a typical designer collaboration. They agreed to a 10-year deal starting this month, with the option to renew after five years, according to a person familiar with the negotiations, who was not authorized to speak publicly. At the five-year point, Gap is hoping that Yeezy Gap will be generating $1 billion in annual sales. For context, Gap’s brand brought in $4.6 billion in global revenue last year.Gap did not respond to a request for comment on the terms of the deal.Gap Inc., which also owns Old Navy and Banana Republic, is aiming to refocus its namesake brand, which has seen sales plummet in the past few years, closed more than 100 North American stores and struggled to define its place within the apparel industry. It, like other retailers, has also been badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic.Mr. West, who worked at a Gap in his teens, has expressed deep interest in the brand for years, declaring in a 2015 interview that he would “like to be the Steve Jobs of the Gap,” and once dreamed of being its head creative director. He has visited its San Francisco headquarters and met with Art Peck, Gap Inc.’s former chief executive.The Gap deal will fulfill a desire of Mr. West’s to make clothing for the masses, even as Yeezy has become a presence at New York and Paris Fashion Weeks. Yeezy merchandise on Farfetch recently included a $925 men’s graphic cardigan and a $241 women’s thermal sweater. At Gap, jeans and tops often cost less than $50 and are regularly discounted.Gap will pay royalties and potential equity to Yeezy, which is solely owned by Mr. West, based on sales performance.Mr. West has successfully worked since 2013 with Adidas, where his brand is positioned as its own category and he earns royalties on net sales of his shoes and apparel, The New York Times reported last June. Yeezy shoes, which can cost hundreds of dollars and even more on secondary markets, were expected to top $1.3 billion in sales last year.The sneaker side of Yeezy was valued at as much as $3 billion last year, Bloomberg reported in April, citing a document from Bank of America.Advertisement",The struggling mall brand plans to introduce Yeezy Gap in stores and online in the first half of 2021.

Biden Jr. and Kamala Harris, former political rivals, used their first public appearance as running mates on the Democratic ticket to stand unified against President Trump.In her first official appearance as Mr. Biden’s vice-presidential pick, Ms. Harris, a former prosecutor, repeatedly assailed Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the economic upheaval it has caused.“As somebody who has presented my fair share of arguments in court, the case against Donald Trump and Mike Pence is open and shut,” Ms. Harris said.The appearance, held at Alexis I. duPont High School in Wilmington, Del., offered the first indication of how Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris, two Democrats from opposite coasts and different generations, would fuse their messages as they sought to unseat Mr. Trump this fall.The two cast themselves as the right pair to guide a nation that has been upended in recent months, both by the virus and by nationwide protests over racial inequality and police brutality.“This is a moment of real consequence for America,” Ms. Harris said. “Everything we care about, our economy, our health, our children, the kind of country we live in, it’s all on the line.”Throughout his campaign, Mr. Biden has repeatedly emphasized his experience working with former President Barack Obama as a chief strength of his.In her remarks on Wednesday, Ms. Harris also pointed to that legacy.Mr. Trump, she said, “inherited the longest economic expansion in history, from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground.”As Ms. Harris repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, which has claimed more than 165,000 Americans’ lives, she contrasted it with Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden’s management during the much smaller ebola outbreak in 2014.“That is what’s called leadership,” she said. “But compare that to the moment we find ourselves in now.”The event also marked a significant first, with Ms. Harris taking to the stage as the first Black woman and the first person of Indian descent to be nominated for national office by a major political party.As he introduced Ms. Harris as his running mate for the first time, Mr. Biden leaned heavily on the qualities that set her apart and added diversity to the Democratic ticket. He presented her as a historic candidate, and someone whose background reflected a diversifying country.“This morning, all across the nation, little girls woke up, especially little Black and brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities,” Mr. Biden said. “But today just maybe they’re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way: as the stuff of president and vice presidents.”Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris also presented themselves as better able than Mr. Trump to respond to the national debate over systemic racism and criminal justice that emerged after the death of George Floyd in May.Mr. Biden noted that the pair’s public appearance marked the third anniversary of a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in which a young anti-racism activist was killed by a white supremacist who plowed his car down a narrow street packed with people.He said that Mr. Trump’s insistence after the killing that “both sides” were to blame for the violence motivated his presidential run.“I knew we were in the battle for the soul of the nation,” Mr. Biden said. “That’s when I decided to run. And I am proud now to have Senator Harris at my side.”Mr. Biden, who has said in the past that he wanted a vice president with whom he was “simpatico” also stressed that he and Ms. Harris shared similar values and ideals that would guide their campaign.“One of the reasons that I chose Kamala is that we both believe that we can define America simply in one word: possibilities,” he said.— Michael Gold President Trump, his Republican allies and conservative hosts on Fox News unfurled a string of sexist attacks on Senator Kamala Harris, a day after she was chosen by Joseph R.

Anyone can read what you share.By Danny Hakim and Maggie HabermanKanye West wants to bring back prayer in schools, give more government support to religious groups and has even asked his campaign staff to refrain from “fornicating” outside of marriage, according to people aiding his candidacy.Mr. West, the billionaire hip-hop artist and fashion mogul turned Christian revivalist, is not running for president, but “walking,” as he puts it. He entered the race late and is not going to make the ballot in states including Florida, Texas and Michigan, but he will be on the ballot in others like Colorado, Minnesota and Iowa. Some Democrats fear he could be a spoiler, even if his political appeal is minuscule. Third-party candidacies don’t need that many votes to make an impact, as Jill Stein showed in 2016 and Ralph Nader in 2000.In calls and texts with The New York Times, and in other recent comments, Mr. West made clear he believes he will become president — eventually — but said almost nothing about what he actually wanted to do if elected. Indeed, Mr. West’s curio candidacy has confused many fans and voters alike. His party is called the Birthday Party. His first piece of campaign art included pictures of that well-known populist Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, and of the actress Kirsten Dunst, who was puzzled. (“What’s the message here,” she tweeted, “and why am I apart of it?”)An inescapable element of Mr. West’s candidacy is his bipolar disorder, which he has spoken about in the past. His wife, Kim Kardashian West, opened up about it for the first time days after Mr. West’s only campaign appearance, in South Carolina, during which he broke down crying. Writing on Instagram, she called him a “brilliant but complicated person” who has to deal with “pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bipolar disorder.”Because a variety of allies and supporters of President Trump are working on the ground to advance his campaign, many Democrats view his candidacy as a dirty trick by Republicans, a notion Mr. West has rejected. Still, in a year in which the president is working to undermine confidence in the election, Mr. West’s candidacy is one more point of uncertainty. And many Republicans, including Mr. Trump, appear confident he will siphon votes from Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, though his appeal could be blunted by some of his conservative positions.Mr. West has a bare-bones platform, focusing on general objectives like reforming the police, reducing household and student loan debt, and “restoring prayer in the classroom,” with each point reinforced by a bit of scripture. In discussions, the topic he brought up most was his opposition to abortion. He does not, however, want to ban abortion.“You can’t do that,” he said in a phone call. “I don’t want to ban or stop or point fingers at anything.” Instead, he said he supported “stipends for families that need support, creating orphanages that are really high-level desirable for people to go to, and the redesign of communities and cities in general to be supporting of families.”He didn’t elaborate on his views on other issues when asked, saying at one point that he had an album to finish.On Wednesday, Mr. West renewed questions about his behavior after tweeting a video in which someone appeared to urinate on a Grammy statuette; referring to himself as “baby Putin”; and, in a tweet that was removed by Twitter, posting the phone number of a top magazine editor whom he called a “white supremacist.”A number of consulting firms are aiding his candidacy. Mercury Public Affairs, a prominent bipartisan New York political consulting firm, played an organizing role, though the firm was dismissed last month and was reluctant to discuss the matter.“Our role was limited to helping the campaign get started up, primarily by helping to recruit a ballot access team and launch that effort,” said Michael McKeon, a partner at Mercury. “For a short time, we served as a liaison between the campaign and the team until they established independent relationships. That happened weeks ago, ending our involvement.”Mr. McKeon would not say why Mercury was not included in the companies that received disbursements in the West campaign’s recent filing to the Federal Election Commission, which showed that Mr. West had lent the campaign nearly $7 million.The filing showed that Mr. West had also brought on both a Republican-oriented firm, the Atlas Strategy Group, and a Democratic-leaning one, Millennial Strategies, to help get him on the ballot. Millennial, however, bailed out after less than a month on the job, shortly after his South Carolina appearance, during which he said that Harriet Tubman “never actual",Even those around the hip-hop artist struggle to explain his motivations for a presidential candidacy that some Democrats worry could siphon votes from Joe Biden.,Stop it.

(Wyoming does not have laws forbidding photos of completed ballots.)He subsequently shared a second video of his ballot being scanned, which he called “the first vote of my life.”Mr. West’s campaign was dogged by questions from its inception. When the music mogul launched his bid, some Democrats feared that Mr. West, who has previously voiced his support for President Trump, could be a spoiler in competitive states, siphoning votes that might have gone to Joseph R. Biden Jr.Though Mr. West ran as an independent — his party is called the Birthday Party — Republican-aligned political operatives were later found to be assisting Mr. West’s efforts to qualify for the ballot.Even with the help, Mr. West’s candidacy was marked by a struggle to make the ballot in most states.

Anyone can read what you share.By Michael Levenson, Evan Nicole Brown and Ben SisarioKim Kardashian West has filed for divorce, seeking to end a nearly seven-year marriage to Kanye West that had become an endless source of celebrity news, family turmoil and brand sponsorships, a spokeswoman for Ms. Kardashian West said on Friday.The spokeswoman, Christy Welder, would not elaborate on the filing, which would dissolve a union that came to be known as Kimye. Ms. Kardashian West, 40, and Mr. West, 43, have four children: North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm.Their tumultuous marriage was tracked incessantly by the media; became fodder for occasional episodes of her long-running reality show, “Keeping Up With the Kardashians”; and was documented for millions on their Instagram and Twitter accounts.Ms. Kardashian West was often said to be famous for being famous, but she spun her reality-show prominence into a number of businesses and products, including Skims shapewear, underwear and loungewear; KKW Fragrance; KKW Beauty; and “Kim Kardashian: Hollywood,” a game for mobile devices.She also became active in the movement for criminal justice reform. In 2018, President Donald J. Trump commuted the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman who had been serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug conviction, after Ms. Kardashian West visited Mr. Trump at the White House and helped bring her case to his attention.transcript“What do you accept that you want to do? What don’t you want to do? Take us inside the Kardashian-Jenner empire.” “Well for a paid post, I am really cautious about like what I spend. So if I overspend on something, and a paid post happens to come in at that time, I’ll weigh it out and think, O.K., well, I have to pay for x, y and z. So this paid post —” “Well you mean your own personal expenses?” “Yes, my own personal expenses or if I’m even like, O.K., you know we have schooling projects. And now it’s a little bit more personal for me if I have a paid post that comes in, and I think, O.K., well, this can fund x amount of people that are behind bars that can help free them with simple legal fees that they just can’t afford. Then that would be worth it to me, even if the post might be a little bit off brand for me. I really weigh out different things now than I used to. There’s a lot that we have to get done in prison reform, and I believe I will be more beneficial if I just focus on that at the moment. So I’m grateful for that relationship in that area. And I focus on that. But that was a big thing where people, so many people advised me, don’t go to the White House. And that didn’t make sense to me because I was like, a life — if someone can get out of prison and get their life back versus my reputation of going to the White House where there’s only one person on this planet that can make the decision, and that would be the president. And that was even a question of — for the media, that just absolutely didn’t make sense to me. I would go see anyone in power that would have that decision to change someone’s life.” “If my family wasn’t so — they didn’t work so hard, and they weren’t so omnipresent, maybe I would just rest on my laurels of just being the greatest artist of human existence and that would just be enough. But that’s shown that that is not enough. That you have to, you know, you have to you hit the gym that you know, you have to communicate, that you have to — it’s a modern day. It’s like modern-day Medici or Rome. It’s an era that people will remember for all of human existence.” “I’m so proud of them. And I think that one thing that a lot of people probably, maybe they do, but you know, a lot of people don’t realize is the work ethic is second to none. And I think just watching them grow and build their companies, getting more and more independent within their own brands and figuring it out and the creativity, the way they work together. I think that we’re building something so fantastic. And just being able to figure out what really works for each one of them is very rewarding for me. And hopefully in 10 years, I can sit back and watch them do it all by themselves.”Mr. West is widely regarded as one of the godfathers of contemporary hip-hop, with a profound influence on younger stars like Drake. He has also fully embraced the model of the pop artist as commercial branding exponent, working with Adidas and Gap on consumer products like his Yeezy sneakers.But his career as a solo performing artist has been on shaky ground for at least five years.In early 2016, he announced an album, “The Life of Pablo,” with a chaotic rollout that would set the stage for most of his projects since.

For the following two nights, West sent — and, in most cases, deleted — tweets detailing a strained relationship with his family. At one point, he claimed the horror film “Get Out” was based on him. He also stated that Kardashian tried to get him medical attention and, later on, claimed he has been trying to divorce her.The Kardashian-Jenners have mostly remained silent amid reports that they are concerned about West being in the midst of a manic episode brought on by his bipolar disorder. But Kardashian’s statement, posted in several slides on her Instagram story, explicitly addressed her husband’s mental health and well-being.“I understand Kanye is subject to criticism because he is a public figure and his actions at times can cause strong opinions and emotions,” she wrote. “He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother … has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder.” Kardashian, seemingly responding to criticism directed at her, added that family members are essentially “powerless” in the process of getting help for loved ones who aren’t minors.Both Kardashian and West have publicly spoken about the latter’s mental health before. West discussed his diagnosis and 2016 hospitalization for a “psychiatric emergency” in an episode of David Letterman’s “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction” released in May 2019: “I ramp up, and I go high,” West said. In that same month’s Vogue cover story, Kardashian commented on the “hurtful things that I read online” regarding West and how she responds to his scrutinized behavior.“Like it’s my fault if he does or says something that they don’t agree with?” she said. “That’s my husband. I share every opinion that I have and let him know when I think something’s wrong. Or if it comes to him being in the middle of a bipolar episode, I’ll do everything to be supportive and help to calm the situation.” Read more:‘I do not want to take Kanye West seriously.

Deadlines are rapidly approaching in others. It remains unclear whether he could mobilize quickly enough to be much of a factor in the race — or if he will actually follow through with a bid.At one point in the interview, West said, “I’m walking. I’m not running.”His tweet on Saturday prompted speculation that his bid could be an attempt to siphon off African American votes from Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, in an effort to bolster Trump.Speaking to Forbes, West made clear that he’s not a fan of the former vice president, comparing him unfavorably to past Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.“Joe Biden?” West said. “Like come on man, please. You know? Obama’s special. Trump’s special. We say Kanye West is special. America needs special people that lead. Bill Clinton? Special. Joe Biden’s not special.”In an interview Tuesday with RealClearPolitics, Trump said a 2020 bid by West would be “a trial run” for 2024 in his view.“It’d have to be limited to certain states because in some states the deadline has been missed,” Trump said, adding that he finds the prospect “very interesting.”","'God just gave me the clarity and said its time,' West said in an interview published Wednesday.

Who could be so brazen, unexpected, reckless and effective? Who could capture votes, mainstream media attention and social media hits? Only one name came to mind.“I was convinced that person was Kanye West,” Woodbury said.His colleagues cackled then. Now they’re taking a closer look at the very real impact West could have on the 2020 presidential election.But like so many citizens of Presidential Election Town — journalists, commentators, strategists, data analysts, etc. — when it comes to West, Woodbury is of two distinct minds.“I do not want to take Kanye West seriously,” said Woodbury, a partner at HIT Strategies, a political research firm focused on women, minorities and millennials. “But I know that we have to.”And that’s the core of the conundrum called Kanye in 2020.He’s a Grammy-winning musical genius. He’s a MAGA hat-wearing booster for President Trump. Wait, no — he took the hat off. But he still thinks Trump is pretty great. West’s music — sounding like an exposed nerve at times and a blood-slicked blade at others — has spoken to the black community’s triumphs and tragedies. Then he said that the 400 years of enslavement African Americans endured sounded “like a choice.” He has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He proudly does not take his prescribed medication.West is a frustrating puzzle for fans and critics alike. The pieces look like they should fit together to form a cohesive picture, but some are too jagged, others too smooth. And none can be simply left in the box.After announcing his candidacy via Twitter on the Fourth of July, the roller coaster that is West’s path to the White House began.Could he even run? The deadline to get his name printed on the ballot in several states had already passed. On July 8, West called Forbes magazine  — whose validation he seemingly craves because of the publication’s billionaires list — to talk policy. The resulting interview is a brain dump of bizarre ideas involving the fictional country of Wakanda and Tesla chief Elon Musk.The next day, TMZ reported that West’s family (read: the Kardashian machine) was concerned that he was in the throes of a manic episode brought on by his bipolar disorder.Opinion: Don’t take Kanye West seriously or literally — yetLater, New York magazine reported that Steve Kramer, a New York-based campaign consultant who said he had been working with West, declared that the rapper was officially “out” of the race. But about the same time, Ye was hitting send on a Twitter video showing the superstar registering to vote for the first time. And on Wednesday, West filed the Federal Election Commission paperwork required to appear on the ballot in Oklahoma.Is your head spinning? Are your eyes rolling? Fair enough. But — according to Chris Redfield —  we still can’t ignore Kanye West.Redfield is the research director at Redfield & Wilton Strategies based in the United Kingdom. On Tuesday, his firm released results of the first national U.S. poll with West’s name included as a candidate in the November election. Of the 2,000 registered U.S. voters polled, 2 percent said they would vote for West.“Most don’t take him seriously and don’t think he is actually going to run. That it’s just [West] injecting himself into a public debate,” Redfield said.But publicity stunt or no, it would be a mistake, added Redfield, to simply discount the “College Dropout” hitmaker.As a rule, the polling firm pays close attention to third-party candidates because of their potential to shake up the status quo. That was the calculus at Redfield & Wilton for adding West into their data research. So, for as long as it is officially possible for West to be in the race, the firm will be tracking his progress.“We measure all the variables that could have an impact,” Redfield said. “It would be a mistake not to at least look at the prospect of what happens if he does run.”That’s the major question: What could happen? What do the next four months of political discourse look like if West continues to flirt with a presidential run?Even with the leaks in cultural capital because of his own combustible comments about slavery, Trump and the 13th Amendment, West is still viewed by some as a powerful symbol of protest.His first real political moment came in 2005. From the stage of a live Hurricane Katrina telethon fundraiser, the rapper went completely off script (or did he?) and declared, “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” That was almost a decade and a half ago.

WP,Kanye West,4,‘Woefully uninformed’: Kanye West slammed for saying Harriet Tubman ‘never actually freed the slaves’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/20/kanye-harriet-tubman/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=wp_main,"This article is more than 1 year oldWhen Toni Fulton and her sister jumped in the car Sunday for a roughly two-hour road trip through South Carolina to attend Kanye West’s first campaign event since the rapper declared he was running for president earlier this month, neither could predict what would await them at the venue in North Charleston.But the last thing the Fultons expected was to find themselves angrily marching out of the event after being there for only 20 minutes.The cause of their sudden exit? West declaring onstage that famed abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who has been called “the Moses of her people,” “never actually freed the slaves.”“She just had the slaves go work for other white people,” West said. Loud groans and unintelligible murmuring immediately erupted from the large crowd of several hundred people who had gathered at the Exquis Event Center. “Come on, man,” a voice shouted out.Meanwhile, the Fulton sisters, who are black, decided they had seen enough. In a now-viral video capturing West’s comment, Toni Fulton made her exasperation with the Grammy Award-winning artist clear in a single statement. “Yo, we leavin’ right now,” she could be heard saying in the background of the short clip as it abruptly cut off.“We’re young, black women and there weren’t a lot of us in the room,” Fulton, 30, told The Washington Post. “We know better than to be in a space that we’re not uplifted in. While he was saying a lot of crazy things that didn’t directly offend us, that was offensive and it wasn’t appropriate for us to be there anymore.”West, who is trying to get on the ballot in South Carolina, spoke for about an hour during Sunday’s freewheeling campaign rally, bouncing between a variety of subjects ranging from abortion and religion to international trade. But his claim about Tubman swiftly became the most-talked-about moment from the event. Video clips circulated widely online, prompting critics and historians to share facts about Tubman’s storied legacy and urge West, who faced intense backlash in 2018 for saying 400 years of African American enslavement sounded “like a choice,” to educate himself.By early Monday, “Kanye” and Tubman’s name were still top trending terms on Twitter as social media exploded with reactions to his remarks, which one prominent Tubman scholar decried as “completely irrational” in an interview with The Washington Post.“There’s something about that little, petite, black woman, who did so much, that seems to bother him,” said Kate Clifford Larson, author of the 2003 biography “Bound for the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero.” Larson noted that West has referenced the abolitionist critically in past years.“She put up with a lot of abuse her whole life,” Larson said of Tubman. “She’s getting the attention and accolades that she deserves. Why tear her down now? It’s just ridiculous.”Representatives for West did not respond to requests for comment late Sunday.The renewed backlash over West’s interpretation of history comes as he is attempting to collect the 10,000 signatures needed by noon Monday to appear on the South Carolina ballot, the Associated Press reported. West, 43, announced July 4 on Twitter that he was mounting a long-shot bid for the presidency, even though the deadline to get his name on ballots in several states had already passed. Still, West recently managed to qualify for the general election ballot in Oklahoma — and political experts have warned that it would be a mistake to ignore the hitmaker, citing the influence third-party candidates have had on past elections, The Post’s Helena Andrews-Dyer reported.“People want to dismiss the irrational,” pollster Terrance Woodbury told Andrews-Dyer. “It sounded irrational five years [ago] that Donald Trump would be president. It’s only crazy until someone pulls it off.”‘I do not want to take Kanye West seriously. But I know that we have to.’For Fulton, West’s fledgling presidential run bears marked similarities to President Trump’s 2016 campaign, and the Columbia, S.C., native told The Post on Sunday that she and her sister, both Democrats, felt the North Charleston rally “just seemed like a moment that we shouldn’t miss.”“She sent a text that said, ‘Hey, do you want to see the circus?’” Fulton said.It didn’t take Fulton long to determine that West’s rally wouldn’t be like any other standard campaign event. First, she said she noticed that the crowd was mostly young people and “sneakerheads,” sporting their distinctive pricey footwear, while other attendees arrived wearing concert T-shirts.Perhaps, she thought, West would perform a few of his songs during his first official introduction as a presidential candidate. She anticipated that the event, albeit not a typical rally, would “introduce the world to the professional, presidential side of Kanye West.”Instead, the rapper strode onstage a few minutes after 5 p.m. wearing a protective vest that had “SECURITY” emblazoned across the front.

His campaign reported raising $6.8 million in July and August, all but $11,000 of which came from West’s own pockets.Of the $5.9 million spent, a large portion, $4.4 million, was spent on ballot-access services. Several lawsuits have been filed to keep West off the ballots. Judges in Virginia and Arizona were the latest to ruled this week that state election officials remove West from those states’ ballots.Neither West’s campaign nor the firms paid to help the candidate get on ballots immediately responded to request for comment.The West campaign paid $1.5 million to Fortified Consulting based out of Tempe, Ariz. The address listed for this company is the same as the address for Lincoln Strategy Group led by Nathan Sproul, who worked for President Trump’s campaign in 2016 and was formerly the executive director of the Arizona Republican Party.In previous years, Sproul’s companies have been hired by the Republican National Committee and other Republican candidates.The campaign also paid $1.3 million to Atlas Strategy Group led by Greg Keller, a longtime Republican operative. Keller is the former executive director of the American Conservative Union and has met with President Trump to interview as a campaign manager for his 2016 campaign.In at least five states Republican operatives have been involved with West’s efforts to get on the November ballots, according to a Washington Post analysis of public filings and social media posts, raising suspicion that some are hoping West, who has been a supporter of Trump, can siphon votes away from Democratic nominee Joe Biden in what could be very close contests around the country.The company paid the most by the campaign, $2.6 million, was New York-based communications firm Millennial Strategies. The group previously worked for former South Bend mayor and Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg.West also spent $95,000 on an air charter company.The next look at West’s campaign finances will be on Oct. 20, two weeks before the election.",This is the first financial filing by the rapper's campaign since he formally filed to run as an independent representing the 'Birthday Party' West spent,Must be nice.,Ugh.

WP,Kanye West,6,Kim Kardashian files for divorce from Kanye West,https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/02/19/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-divorce/?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social,"Kim Kardashian has filed for divorce from Kanye West, her representative confirmed Friday. The couple, who share four children, married in 2014, after two years of dating.Rumors of Kardashian, 40, and West, 43, splitting up have circulated in recent weeks, following a tumultuous year for the couple. West announced on the Fourth of July that he intended to run for president, displaying erratic behavior at a campaign rally later that month and soon afterward on Twitter. He said Kardashian had been trying to get him medical attention, and that he intended to divorce her.A representative for West hasn’t responded to The Washington Post’s request for comment.Kardashian largely stayed silent on the matter of her husband’s mental health but spoke out via her Instagram Story later in July. She requested “compassion and empathy,” noting that family members can be “powerless” in their efforts to get help for someone who isn’t a minor.“I understand Kanye is subject to criticism because he is a public figure and his actions at times can cause strong opinions and emotions,” she wrote. “He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother … has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder.”Kardashian and West were longtime friends before they began dating in 2012, soon after Kardashian separated from her second husband, former NBA player Kris Humphries. In 2015, the New York Times referred to the merging of their public personas — Kardashian’s reality television series and entrepreneurial efforts, along with West’s superstar career as a rapper and newfound designer — as a “historic blizzard of celebrity.” West was reluctant to appear on “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” at first, but took on a more prominent role several years into their marriage.The Kardashian-Jenner family announced last fall that the reality series would be ending with the season that debuts next month, concluding a 14-year run that tracked their growth from cable TV stars to business moguls. They landed a multiyear deal with Hulu for projects that will begin airing later this year.Read more:It’s official: Kim and Kanye are no moreKim Kardashian addresses Kanye West’s mental health, asks for ‘compassion and empathy’‘I do not want to take Kanye West seriously.

That's according to the Small Business Administration, which disclosed this week the list of companies that received more than $150,000.While some very small companies struggled to access aid from the program, especially early on, West's $3 billion streetwear brand is one of several companies with wealthy or well-connected owners to receive loans from the program. West is hardly the only billionaire to run a company that received a sizable loan. Rich people receiving government funds looks bad, especially considering how many non-famous owners found themselves unable to collect the money they needed to keep their businesses alive. But these companies were eligible for money including potentially forgivable loans, so it's little wonder they pursued it.Yeezy did not return a request for comment for this story. The companies approved for these larger loans garnered around 75% of the program's total funding -- even though they represent a minority of the more than 4 million borrowers who took part in the program, according to the SBA and Treasury Department.Many small companies said early in the process that they struggled to access the SBA money, and others fear the program still won't be adequate to ensure their survival as the pandemic continues. And some experts say that risk of disparity was evident from the get-go.""Right at the beginning, I flagged that I didn't think it was going to go well for [an] obvious reasons: They put the banks as the intermediaries,"" said Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economics professor at Columbia University and author of ""People, Power and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent.""While the SBA managed the PPP funding, it was up to banks to disburse the loans. They had an ""obvious incentive"" to help well-off customers from whom they make a lot of money or had prior relationships, said Stiglitz, who was also an economic adviser to the Clinton Administration. A bank might be more eager to lend to a company that had taken out previous business loans — a way for the bank to mitigate risk — than to, say, a small restaurant who was new to them. But that may have put some of the smallest enterprises at a disadvantage. Beyond Yeezy, the list of companies that received the larger loans includes at least $9 million for elite membership club Soho House, controlled by billionaire Ron Burkle, and between $5 million and $10 million to Gores Vitac Holdings, a division of the company owned by billionaire Alec Gores.And several major chain restaurants including Shake Shack (SHAK) and Ruth's Chris Steakhouse said they would return PPP funds amid public backlash in April, when the first round of funds ran dry.""It was clearly not the intent of Congress, and it undermines the credibility of the bailout when you have money that was supposed to go to people on the verge of bankruptcy going to companies [with wealthy owners],"" Stiglitz said. How Yeezy and other big names received big loans Still, it's hardly surprising companies took advantage of an attractive offer: low-interest, no-collateral and potentially forgivable federal money for qualified companies to help cover employees' paychecks. (It's not yet clear which and how many companies will have their loans forgiven, and by how much.)West's Yeezy received a loan worth between $2 million and $5 million from California's City National Bank to retain 106 jobs, according to the SBA data.Retail overall has been hurt by the pandemic, with shops closed and mass unemployment, but Yeezy was never aimed at average consumers with its $260 cotton shirts and $381 nylon leggings. (The loan is for only Yeezy's apparel business — Yeezy shoes are produced by Adidas (ADDYY).)The PPP loan was approved in April, two months before West publicly announced a partnership to produce Yeezy apparel for Gap (GPS), in a statement that pegged Yeezy's valuation at nearly $3 billion.While Yeezy might not be the business intended by spirit of the program, the PPP was ""designed to help any firm meeting the definition of a small business, in terms of employees or revenues,"" said Shanthi Nataraj, senior economist and director of the labor and workforce development program at the nonpartisan think tank RAND Corporation.""It wasn't designed to [consider] if your owner has a certain amount of assets or is a well known person ... Simply because you have a wealthy owner doesn't mean you aren't eligible.""

Anyone who has this or has a loved one in their life who does, knows how incredibly complicated and painful it is to understand,' she wrote. ""I've never spoken publicly about how this has affected us at home because I am very protective of our children and Kanye's right to privacy when it comes to his health. But today, I feel like I should comment on it because off the stigma and misconceptions about mental health.""She went on to call her husband a ""brilliant but complicated"" person and pointed out the struggles he has dealt with, including the loss of his mother, Donda West, in 2007. ""I understand Kanye is subject to criticism because he is a public figure and his actions at times can cause strong opinions and emotions,"" she continued. ""He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder.

The source added that West was evaluated by a doctor on Monday who decided that he did not need to be hospitalized but that he will undergo another evaluation on Wednesday. But the source would not comment on the posts West made about his marriage. Kardashian West's post comes three days after West held a presidential campaign rally in North Charleston, South Carolina, in which he emotionally spoke about his faith, his late mother and his family. The appearance caused some media personalities and others on social media to speculate about West's wellbeing.West has previously been open about his mental health. He spoke to David Letterman last year and said that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and discussed an involuntary psychiatric hold he underwent in 2016.""They have this moment where they put you, they handcuff you, they drug you, they put you on the bed, and they separate you from everyone you know,"" he said. ""That's something that I am so happy that I experienced myself so I can start by changing that moment.""""When you're in this state, you're hyper-paranoid about everything, everyone,"" West explained at the time. ""This is my experience, other people have different experiences. Everyone now is an actor. Everything's a conspiracy. You feel the government is putting chips in your head. You feel you're being recorded. You feel all these things.""West has previously said he does not regularly take medication for his condition. His wife seemed to address that she is somewhat powerless in helping her husband seek help without him agreeing to seek it himself.""Those that understand mental illness or even compulsive behavior know that the family is powerless unless the member is a minor,"" she wrote. ""People who are unaware or far removed from this experience can be judgmental and not understand that the individual themselves have to engage in the process of getting help no matter how hard family and friends try.""Her husband posted a series of since-deleted tweets on social media late Tuesday, suggesting he has considered divorcing Kardashian West. She did not address any specific statements from her husband in her post. ""We as a society talk about giving grace to the issue of mental health as a whole, however we should also give it to the individuals who are living with it in times when they need it the most,"" she concluded.

CNN,Kanye West,7,Election commission votes to keep Kanye West off Wisconsin presidential ballot,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/20/politics/kanye-west-not-on-wisconsin-2020-ballot/index.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twCNN&utm_content=2020-08-22T13:36:30,"By Lauren Peller, CNNUpdated 8:21 PM ET, Sat August 22, 2020  (CNN)The Wisconsin Elections Commission voted Thursday to keep Kanye West off the general election presidential ballot after determining the hip hop star had filed late, a move that keeps him from potentially competing in a key battleground state in November.   CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Eric Bradner and Dan Merica contributed to this report.The 5-1 vote came after the commission's staff released a report Tuesday concluding that West and his running mate, Michelle Tidball, had not filed nomination papers on time, by 5 p.m. on Aug. 4.The commissioners, three Republicans and three Democrats, rejected the argument by West's attorney, Michael Curran, that the campaign had until 5:01 p.m. to file.  Wisconsin state law states that candidates must file nomination papers ""not later"" than 5 p.m. Jeffrey Mandell, an attorney for Wisconsin's Democratic Party, said the evidence is clear that West's team filed the papers late and ""they cannot be allowed."" ""Five o'clock is five o'clock,"" Republican Commissioner Dean Knudson said. ""Maybe I'm just common sense and not a lawyer."" Republican Robert Spindell was the only commissioner to vote in favor of West, arguing that the commission should give West the opportunity.The commission also voted 6-0 to grant ballot access to the Libertarian presidential ticket but tied 3-3 on whether the Green Party should have it, which is now expected to be settled in court.Mark Jefferson, the executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party, said in a statement that Wisconsin Democrats had ""successfully fought to deny ballot access to an African American because he was seconds late with his paperwork.""   ""The left wants to clear any liberal competition for Democrats, while ensuring a Libertarian is on the ballot to siphon votes from Republicans,"" Jefferson said. ""Democrats are only interested in voter enfranchisement if they believe they will benefit. If they don't benefit, they don't care."" Libertarian Gary Johnson received 106,674 votes in 2016 in Wisconsin, according to CNN's results.Ann Jacobs, the chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission and a Democrat, said she does not see any ""hypocrisy"" in the commission's decision not to grant ballot access to West.  ""I do not think it's unreasonable to expect people who are seeking higher office to do something as simple as walk through a door before 5 o'clock at night, which is the deadline,"" Jacobs told reporters. Black Democratic officials and progressive activists in Wisconsin had reacted largely with disgust to West's efforts in what is expected to be among the most crucial swing states in November's election. But some expressed trepidation that -- if the presidential race is a nail-biter there -- West earning even a fraction of the 188,000 votes that went to third-party or independent candidates in the state four years ago could become a significant factor.Republican operatives, some with ties to President Donald Trump, have helped West try to get on presidential general election ballots in states from Vermont to Arkansas. Some of the states where West has filed are reviewing his petitions.  The effort is raising questions about whether Republicans are pushing for the rapper's addition to the ballot as a way to potentially siphon voters from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. The effort has been effectively green-lit by Trump, who said earlier this month that he had ""nothing to do"" with West qualifying for states' ballots but that the rapper has ""got a good heart, a very good heart. And I like Kanye very much.""Trump won Wisconsin by less than 1 percentage point in 2016.  The Republican strategy seizes on a perceived lack of support for Biden among young Black voters, despite the fact that Biden largely won the Democratic primary because of his deep support among Black voters.Polling shows that Biden enjoys a massive lead with Black voters -- an analysis of 10 polls from CNN's Harry Enten in July found he leads among Black voters, 83% to 8%.But Biden's support among Black adults is not monolithic and is far stronger with older Black adults. A recent Washington Post poll found that 87% of Black seniors said the former vice president is ""sympathetic to the problems of Black people in America,"" while that figure drops to 66% with adults under 40.West's candidacy is a clear attempt to play into that dichotomy -- mimicking the Trump campaign's twofold strategy to both court younger Black men at the same time that his campaign attempts to suppress support for Biden.This story has been updated with comments from the Wisconsin Republican Party executive director and the Wisconsin Elections Commission chair.","The Wisconsin Elections Commission voted to keep Kanye West off the general election presidential ballot.

The phone was available at a similar price on online marketplace Taobao.Consumers are increasingly worried over the supply of components for newer handsets, said one vendor.“The Huawei phones are getting expensive but that’s supply and demand,” said the vendor, who gave her name as Xiao. “If people like the brand, they’ll pay more - and who knows how good the chips they’ll have in the future will be?”The U.S. government last year moved to prevent most U.S. companies from conducting business with Huawei, saying the world’s biggest maker of mobile telecommunications equipment and smartphones was ultimately answerable to the Chinese government. Huawei has repeatedly denied being a national security risk.Last month, the United States further tightened restrictions to choke its access to commercially available chips, prompting Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW to stop shipping wafers to Huawei.Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei’s consumer business, subsequently said the company will stop making its Kirin chips on Sept. 15 because of U.S. measures to cut off its chipmaking unit HiSilicon from vital technology.HiSilicon relies on software from U.S. firms such as Cadence Design Systems Inc CDNS.O or Synopsys Inc SNPS.O to design its chips, and outsources production to TSMC, which uses U.S.-made equipment.Wholesale traders at the market said they had been busy for the last month meeting extra demand for online sales, with prices of higher-end phones rising every few hours. They were uncertain how much supply remained at distributors.Huawei does not disclose inventory information. A spokesman told Reuters the firm continues to operate according to demand.It likely has chip inventory to last through the first half of next year, said analyst Will Wong at consultancy IDC.“One option for them to have Kirin chips last longer is to ship less for the rest of the year,” Wong said.Last week, Huawei said it planned to introduce its Harmony operating system on smartphones next year, in part to overcome U.S. limits on its access to Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Android.Yet analyst Mo Jia at Canalys said launching Harmony would only be a “symbolic innovation” if Huawei no longer had the chip supplies to make high-end phones.Reporting by David Kirton; Editing by Christopher Cushing",Chinese consumers are rushing to buy smartphones from Huawei Technologies.

It assembles the Ford Escape and the Lincoln version of that SUV, the Corsair. ""The global semiconductor shortage is presenting challenges and production disruptions -- for the global auto industry, including Ford (F), which could have a significant knock-on effect on jobs and the economy given the importance of auto manufacturing,"" said Ford (F) in a statement.Automakers cut back orders for computer chips early last year when the pandemic slammed the brakes on auto sales and production because of temporary plant closings.When car sales bounced back sooner than expected, it left the industry struggling with a chip shortage. That was exacerbated by increased demand for laptops during the stay-at-home era -- and the electronic and computer industries snapping up the excess supply of chips, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of research at the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan think tank.

But now, Ford (F) and Stellantis are having trouble delivering completed pickups to their dealers. ""They have tried very hard to allocate the chips they get to high-demand and high-profit margin vehicles,"" said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst at AutoTrader. ""But clearly that's being the challenged right now.""Ford announced it has started building the nation's best-selling vehicle, the F-150 pickup, without some of the chips it needs. It will park those unfinished trucks while they await the arrival of the missing chips, rather than shipping them to dealerships.The company has also temporarily shut down one of three shifts at the Kentucky Truck plant where the full-size Expedition and Navigator SUVs are built, as well as the Super Duty pickups.Stellantis, the automaker formed by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA Group, is doing the same with the Ram 1500 Classic pickup, a base version of that truck. The good news for Stellantis is Ram pickup sales may not get dinged, or at least not right away. Krebs said Stellantis has an excess supply of the Ram 1500 Classic — about 143 days' worth. That compares to an average of a 59-day supply for full-size pickups across the industry. The global chip shortageThe chip shortage has been hurting automakers around the globe. Automakers cut back computer chip orders early last year when the pandemic caused temporary plant closures and slammed the brakes on auto sales and production. Electronics manufacturers, which enjoyed strong sales during the pandemic, happily snapped up the excess supply.But when car sales bounced back sooner than expected, it left the industry struggling with a chip shortage.The average car has between 50 to 150 chips in it. Some chips can be used in many different models, which has allowed the automakers to keep up production of trucks and SUVs until now. But there are other chips that are specific to each kind of vehicle.General Motors and Ford have both warned investors that the chip shortage will reduce their 2021 earnings by more than a billion dollars.Krebs said automakers are also running into problems because of delays at the nation's ports, which is preventing container ships from unloading shipments of auto parts. These problems taken together could limit US auto sales, she said. ""The supply chain is pretty fragile,"" she said. ""We have a conservative sales forecast due to the tight inventories."" GM (GM) has kept three plants in North America shut down since early February, and the automaker said they will remain closed at least into next month. Those plants don't build full-size pickups or SUVs, but the chip shortage has led GM to tinker with its big vehicle lineup, too.Last week GM confirmed that would build some versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra without a fuel management module that improves mileage by about 1 mile per gallon.

The mileage sticker in the window will also be changed to reflect a lower mileage, according to GM spokeswoman Michelle Malcho.The affected versions of the trucks are those that have a 5.3-liter EcoTec3 V8 engine and either a 6- or 8-speed automatic transmission.

The Japanese company reduced its forecast Thursday for sales of its popular Switch console by about 6%. It now expects to sell 24 million units by the end of the fiscal year, which concludes next March, down from a previous projection of 25.5 million units.The cut is largely due to the shortage of chips used in its hardware, which has caused production snags, the company said in an earnings presentation. It added that ""the extended impact of both Covid-19 and the global semiconductor shortage creates a state of continued uncertainty, with the possibility of future impact on production and shipping.""Nintendo (NTDOF) still plans to make it up to investors by selling more gaming software. It hiked its forecast for that side of the business by about 5%, estimating sales of 200 million units by the end of the fiscal year.The company held its overall forecast for net sales but raised its guidance for profits. It now projects a slight jump in operating profit to 520 billion yen (approximately $4.6 billion), as well as an increase in its dividend by 60 yen (53 cents).That came despite a dreary report card for the six months ended September. Sales fell about 19% to 624.2 billion yen ($5.5 billion) compared with the same period the previous year.

CNN,Chip Shortage,5,Video game consoles and smartphones will be harder to find this holiday season,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/15/tech/tech-gadget-delays/index.html?utm_term=link&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twCNN&utm_content=2021-11-15T20%3A15%3A12,"By Samantha Murphy Kelly, CNN BusinessUpdated 10:01 AM ET, Mon November 15, 2021  (CNN Business)The global chip shortage is making it harder for shoppers to get their hands on some of the most sought after tech gadgets of the holiday season.In the six weeks leading up to Christmas, some of Apple's biggest new products -- including certain iPhone 13 models, some newer iPads and AirPods -- are experiencing delays well into December, depending on model type, colors and the shopper's location, according to analysts and online checks conducted by CNN Business. Last week, some Google Pixel 6 Pro devices were showing late January shipment dates for orders; by Monday, certain models were listed as out of stock on its website. Gaming consoles such as Xbox and PS5 are nearly impossible to find due to delays stemming from Covid-related production challenges and the large gap between supply and demand. The wait times for popular tech products are always changing, but the challenge for shoppers is clear. ""Right now, iPhone 13 and gaming consoles are seeing demand outstrip supply by roughly 20%, which is a telling [sign] for Black Friday and holiday shopping stress,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told CNN Business. ""We have also seen the new AirPods 3 already on back order with shortages into Christmas [week].""The chip shortage, which also has had a major impact on the auto industry, also presents a massive challenge for tech products. For customers, it could require rethinking how early to shop and which specs and products they're willing to live without. For companies, it risks hurting revenue for the all-important holiday sales season and cutting into the sales momentum for some of their recently launched products. Take Apple (AAPL), which is known for having a sophisticated global supply chain to make its products. The iPhone 13, introduced in September, runs on Apple's own A15 Bionic chip, which drives some of its new flagship camera features and an improved battery life. But it also relies on other companies for chips that power certain features, such as displays, power management and USB connectivity. In late October, Apple said chip shortages and manufacturing disruptions tied to Covid-19 slashed $6 billion off its revenue last quarter. It's also reportedly reallocating some of the chips originally planned for iPads to the iPhone to help meet demand. But this means wait times for iPads could get longer.Tech companies such as Samsung (SSNLF) and Microsoft (MSFT) have cited supply chain constraints on recent earnings calls. Some chipmakers have warned that demand will outpace supply through at least 2022.""We are seeing shortages across the board but the premium devices -- which require more chips for power management solutions, micro-controls and certain features -- will be especially hard to find,"" said Gaurav Gupta, a vice president focusing on the semiconductor industry at market research firm Gartner. As of last week, for example, iPhone 13 and iPhone mini models were shipping at faster rates than their Pro counterparts. Apple and Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for Google, Nintendo and Sony also did not respond to requests for comment.Meanwhile, finding one of the newer gaming consoles -- such as NIntendo Switch OLED, PS5 and XBox Series -- is even harder. All these products are out of stock on their company websites. On Sony's website, shoppers can register ""for an opportunity to purchase"" a PS5 via a special invitation. Some retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy are offering access to ""restock events"" for paying members of their subscription clubs. Amazon, which hasn't been charging for early access to gaming consoles, lets shoppers sign up for text messages when they come back in stock -- before quickly selling out again.Filomena Iovino, research analyst at technology intelligence firm ABI Research, said shoppers may have better luck getting certain products depending on where they live.""Geographically, Apple knows its strongest markets for iPhone sales, and these will be the ones prioritized to receive new product shipments,"" Iovino said. ""This may result in a lack of availability, or delayed availability, in lower-tier markets, but should not impact price.""As a general rule, however, customers everywhere should be prepared to shop early and be flexible. ""If someone wants a tech gadget to give for the holidays, buy it now,"" Gupta added. ""Some items might ship in December; some might get extended to January, depending on the product. The more you customize it, the more difficult it will become to buy that gadget.""",Some of Apple's biggest new products are experiencing delays well into December.

WP,Chip Shortage,1,Growing computer-chip shortage alarms Biden and Congress,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/23/biden-semiconductor-shortage-meeting/?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_source=twitter,"President Biden will meet Wednesday with a bipartisan group of lawmakers to confront growing concern about a global shortage of semiconductors that is hobbling automakers and other manufacturers and has led to production cutbacks.News of the meeting, confirmed by people familiar with the matter, came as Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called for Congress to appropriate funds it previously had authorized for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, calling the current lack of production capacity “a dangerous weak spot in our economy and in our national security.”Commonly known as chips, semiconductors are critical to the functioning of a wide range of everyday products, from cellphones to computers to state-of-the-art refrigerators. They are also the brains that operate an array of weapons systems.The chip shortage began after the coronavirus pandemic hit last year. As global demand for automobiles fell, car companies cut production and their purchases of semiconductors needed to build cars. At the same time, demand for semiconductors soared from companies making computers and other equipment that allowed employees to work from home, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.Lawmakers propose billions to boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and researchThen when auto production recovered, car companies faced a shortage of semiconductor supplies.The scarcity has had serious consequences. Ford this month said a lack of chips could cut the company’s production by up to 20 percent in the first quarter. The automaker was forced to reduce the output of its profitable F-150 pickup at two factories in Michigan and Missouri.General Motors said it was forced to cut output at factories in Kansas, Canada and Mexico and would reassess its production plans in mid-March, when it has an update on semiconductor supply.The chip shortfall is reviving calls from industry and members of Congress for more federal funding to subsidize domestic chip manufacturing.In a letter to Biden this month, lobbying groups for the auto, health-care and telecommunications sectors pressed the White House to work with Congress to provide more funding for domestic chip research and production.“While the governments of our global competitors have invested heavily to attract new semiconductor manufacturing and research facilities, the absence of U.S. incentives has made our country uncompetitive and America’s share of global semiconductor manufacturing has steadily declined as a result,” the groups wrote.To counter China, some Republicans are abandoning free-market orthodoxyWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki this month said the chip shortage is “one of the central motivations” for an executive order Biden plans to sign soon “to undertake a comprehensive review of supply chains for critical goods.”“The review will be focused on identifying the immediate actions we can take, from improving the physical production of those items in the U.S., to working with allies to develop a coordinated response to the weaknesses and bottlenecks that are hurting American workers,” Psaki said.U.S. semiconductor companies account for 47 percent of global chip sales, but only 12 percent of global chip manufacturing occurs in the United States, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.In 1990, about 37 percent of global semiconductor production happened in the United States, but the U.S. share has dropped as U.S. companies and others build factories overseas.Taiwan and its chipmaking giant TSMC dominate much of global semiconductor production. China is also investing heavily in chips and is rapidly gaining ground.China’s rapid industrial rise, and the United States’ inability to manufacture enough medical gear and other essential goods during the coronavirus crisis, have prompted bipartisan calls for more federal investment to strengthen domestic manufacturing and research and development.As part of the recently passed National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2021, Congress authorized federal subsidies for companies investing in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and more federal funding for chip research, but Congress has yet to appropriate money for the programs.Schumer on Wednesday said he and a bipartisan group of colleagues would include those appropriations in a bill they plan to introduce soon. Dubbed the Endless Frontier Act, the bill will also devote resources for 5G mobile networks and for research priorities such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, Schumer said.Supplies of automotive semiconductors might not be back to normal for a couple of quarters, analysts said.Brad Slingerlend, an investor at NZS Capital in California and a former semiconductor analyst, said he started raising alarms about U.S. reliance on overseas chips years ago, to no avail.The auto sector’s current plight will draw more attention to the issue, he said. “This needs more of a spotlight on it,” he said.Mario Morales, a semico",Senate Majority Leader Charles E.

WP,Chip Shortage,2,What you need to know about the global chip shortage,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/computer-chip-shortage-explainer-qa/?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social,"Computer chips are everywhere. There are dozens in every car, helping regulate engine temperatures and stabilize suspension systems. They manage water treatment plants, power lines and Internet cables. Almost any product that plugs into a wall now carries a tiny computer inside. The modern world runs on them.And now there’s not enough of them. Here’s what you need to know about a perfect storm of factors that are pushing up prices for consumers and cutting profits for some of America’s biggest corporations.A computer chip, also called a semiconductor or integrated circuit, is a series of electronic circuits printed onto a conducting material, usually silicon. They form the physical building blocks used to make computers and run software. Over the years, chip designers have managed to squeeze more and more circuits into smaller spaces, making computers exponentially faster and cheaper. But the tiny size and complex design laid the groundwork for the current shortage.Unlike car engines or toys, chips need to be built in factories with highly controlled environments, known as “fabs.” Specks of dust, temperature spikes and even static electricity can damage the intricate workings of semiconductors. Meeting unexpected demand isn’t as simple as setting up another production line and hiring a few more workers. New chip fabs cost billions of dollars and can take two years to build. Right now, fabs are running at full capacity, but it will take months or years before new ones come online to fill the extra demand.Growing computer-chip shortage alarms Biden and CongressWhen the pandemic started shutting down parts of the global economy last year, most economists thought consumer spending would drop off a cliff as people lost their jobs or stopped buying nonessential goods. Auto companies cut back on production and ordered fewer of the chips needed to make their cars run. At the same time, millions of people forced to work or learn from home poured money they may have otherwise spent on movie tickets or vacations into TVs, computers and video game systems. Electronics companies bought up all extra chips to meet that demand, and when auto companies realized people still wanted cars it was too late. Now, millions of cars are sitting in factory lots, nearly finished except for the computer chips they need.The pandemic isn’t the only factor at play. New 5G phones use a lot more computer chips than previous generations of handsets. About a quarter of all phones sold in 2020 were 5G-ready, so the industry suddenly put a massive new strain on chip production, said Matt Bryson, a semiconductor company analyst with Wedbush Securities. President Donald Trump’s trade war with China also had an impact. About 10 percent of the world’s chip production comes from SMIC, a semiconductor company that’s partially owned by the Chinese government. In 2020, the U.S. government restricted American companies from selling to SMIC, citing its ties to the Chinese military. Even the demand for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin is a factor. Warehouses full of computers used to run the extremely complicated calculations that make cryptocurrencies possible are chewing up more and more computer chips each year.Biden orders sweeping review of U.S. supply chain weak spotsIt’s not as straightforward as you may think. Chip companies are benefiting from being able to sell at higher prices, but for the most part they are locked into large, long-term deals that can’t be changed on a whim. The biggest winners may be the companies that make the expensive and highly complex manufacturing equipment used to make semiconductors, such as California-based Applied Materials and Lam Research, and Japan-based Tokyo Electron.Consumers. Because of how ubiquitous chips are, prices are going up for all sorts of products. Some high-end computer and gaming components are selling on auction sites such as eBay for double their retail prices. Wait times for new PlayStations and Xboxes may get pushed out further. Many people could find a new car falling just out of reach. “The consumer is a clear loser in this situation,” Bryson said.In first call with China’s Xi, Biden stresses U.S. commitment to allies and human rightsThe shortage could last for a while, partly because of how long it takes to get new fabs online, but also because demand probably won’t slow down, especially as economic activity picks up again through 2021. The shortage is amplifying calls from some U.S. politicians for government to subsidize a stronger homegrown chip industry so American companies don’t need to rely on Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturers. In China, the trade war has prompted the government to stockpile chips and find new sources for components. Even after the pandemic is over, geopolitics will keep roiling the chip industry.",There are dozens of computer chips in every car that plug into a wall. The tiny size and complex design laid the groundwork for the current shortage.,"Congress gave tax breaks for chip companies, like my former company, to go offshore in 2005.

WP,Chip Shortage,3,"Chip shortage spreads, hurting sales at Apple and Samsung",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/29/apple-caterpillar-chip-shortage/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter,"The damage of the global semiconductor shortage continues to widen beyond automakers, with Apple, Samsung and Caterpillar warning this week of current or potential impacts.Apple on Wednesday said a lack of chips is hampering production of iPads and Mac computers, which could cost the company about $3 billion to $4 billion in sales in the quarter ending in June.Caterpillar, the tractor and heavy-machinery manufacturer, said Thursday that it has not yet felt any impact but could later this year. And Samsung said its sales of display panels to smartphone manufacturers have suffered because those manufacturers cannot get enough chips to make handsets.The companies released the details in quarterly earnings reports that were otherwise strong, fueled by soaring demand as the global economy begins to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic. The scarcity of chips could cloud some of that recovery if it continues to hamper manufacturing in the coming months.“It’s already an impediment. For people who want to purchase cars or computers, they are being told some of the products may not be available,” Bernard Baumohl, an economist at the Economic Outlook Group, said in an interview.Trouble in the auto sector continued to deepen this week as well, with Ford saying it expects to produce 1.1 million fewer vehicles this year because it cannot get enough chips. The company expects to lose about half of its second-quarter production, up from about 17 percent in the first quarter.Semiconductor availability “will get worse before it gets better,” Ford said in a statement as it reported earnings. “Currently, the company believes that the issue will bottom out during the second quarter, with improvement through the remainder of the year.”Also this week, Volkswagen said it will suspend production of Jettas and Tiguan SUVs in Mexico next month because of the chip shortage. General Motors, Ford and others also have been idling factories.The roots of the shortage lie in the early weeks of the pandemic, when auto plants worldwide abruptly shut down amid stay-at-home orders. Auto sales plummeted, and car companies and their parts suppliers drastically cut their semiconductor purchases.At the same time, demand for computers and other electronics soared as many consumers began working from home. That caused electronics manufacturers to step up their chip purchases. When auto demand bounced back, car companies found semiconductor factories too busy with other orders to fill their needs.Making matters worse, semiconductor factories in Texas were forced offline during this year’s cold snap and have taken a while to restore production. Fires at two different Japanese factories also have lowered chip output.Ford this week said the more recent fire, at a Renasas Electronics factory in March, particularly hurt auto-chip supply. Ford said it expects shipments from that plant to resume by the end of June.Chip factories cost billions of dollars to build or expand, so there is no simple way to quickly boost production. That has left all chip buyers competing fiercely for scarce supplies.Apple chief executive Tim Cook said Wednesday that shortages of “legacy nodes,” or older-technology chips, are causing the most problems for his company. The most modern smartphones and tablets use the fastest, most high-tech chips but also require more mature chips to perform certain functions, such as operating screen displays.Older-tech chips are also in high demand by automakers and others, making it hard to assess when the supply constraints will ease, Cook said in an earnings call.“There are many different people, not only in the same industry, but across other industries that are using legacy nodes,” Cook said, according to a transcript.Semiconductor manufacturers have focused their investments on factories that can build the latest and most profitable chip technology, leaving less capacity to produce chips of older designs.Samsung is a conglomerate that manufactures a variety of goods — including semiconductors and other industrial components, smartphones and appliances — so the semiconductor gyrations are affecting it in several ways.The company this week reported strong demand for its electronics and chips. But a Samsung plant was among the chip factories in Texas knocked offline this year, hurting the company’s profits. And Samsung expects its sales of mobile display panels to continue to be weak.The White House has been leaning on big chip producers and their host nations, including Taiwan, to increase output. It is also calling for $50 billion in federal funding to incentivize more domestic chip production, though those funds, if approved by Congress, would be too far off to alleviate the current shortages.","Apple, Samsung and Caterpillar warned this week of current or potential impacts.

But a full solution to the problem will take much longer, he said.“We do believe we have the ability to help,” said Gelsinger, who recently took over as CEO of the United States’ largest-by-revenue semiconductor company. But “I think this is a couple of years until you are totally able to address it,” he said. “It just takes a couple of years to build capacity.”Biden can’t fix the chip shortage any time soon. Here’s why.The computer-chip supply crunch, fueled by pandemic supply-chain gyrations and soaring demand, has most visibly hurt automakers, forcing them to temporarily idle factories. But it’s affecting a variety of businesses, Gelsinger said, including manufacturers of personal computers and other equipment.Gelsinger spoke with The Washington Post after attending a virtual White House meeting on Monday to address the problem. At that meeting, he said, medical equipment suppliers worried aloud about a lack of semiconductors.Intel has been talking to automakers and auto-parts suppliers about steps it can take to increase automotive chip production in the coming months, Gelsinger said, confirming details reported earlier by Reuters. Intel is aiming to start delivering that extra supply in six to nine months, he said.“That in no way addresses all of it, but every little bit helps. We can help alleviate some pressure,” said Gelsinger, an electrical engineer who earlier in his career spent 30 years at Intel, helping to design and introduce several microprocessors.General Motors and Ford last week announced plans to temporarily idle several North American factories over the supply problems, although GM on Tuesday scrapped a few of its shutdown plans, saying that a factory in Spring Hill, Tenn., would reopen earlier than planned and that a plant in Mexico would keep operating.“GM’s supply chain organization has made strides working with our supply base to mitigate the near-term impacts of the semiconductor situation” on those factories, spokesman David Barnas said in a statement.General Motors and Ford halt production at more factories as global semiconductor shortage worsensOne problem complicating supply at the moment: Manufacturers are placing chip orders with multiple factories because they aren’t sure which orders will come through, said Willy Shih, a Harvard Business School professor who specializes in technology and manufacturing.“Imagine you’re an automaker and you want more of a chip and you are being quoted a lead time of a year. How many are you going to order? Are you going to order from multiple sources? You bet [you are],” Shih said.The chaotic ordering is making it harder for chipmakers to understand where they need to allocate supply to meet real, short-term needs, he said.To ensure more domestic chip supply in the long term, the Biden administration is proposing spending $50 billion to subsidize semiconductor manufacturing facilities, an idea that has broad bipartisan support.Last week, an auto industry trade association proposed that a portion of that funding be dedicated to building manufacturing capacity for automotive chips.“As you are well aware, as the nation’s largest manufacturing sector, the auto industry contributes $1.1 trillion to the United States economy and represents 5.5 percent of the country’s GDP,” the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said in an April 5 letter to the Commerce Department.Automakers promoted that idea again at the White House’s virtual meeting but met resistance from other industry chiefs who didn’t want any sector to receive preferential treatment, Gelsinger said.“Generally, the others on the call said, boy, that’s not a good policy way to address this,” he said.Gelsinger and another semiconductor chief — Tom Caulfield of GlobalFoundries, headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif. — said they lobbied at the meeting for the United States to set an aggressive goal for expanding domestic chip manufacturing. About 12 percent of the world’s semiconductors are made in the United States. Caulfield said he called for a doubling of that market share, while Gelsinger said he lobbied to push it above 30 percent.“A lot of the discussion was, let’s not waste this crisis. Let’s take the lessons learned — we should have more manufacturing in this country,” Caulfield said in an interview.Meeting such ambitious targets would require government funding beyond the $50 billion currently proposed, and much more investment from industry, Gelsinger said.

WP,Chip Shortage,5,How the global chip shortage might affect people who just want to wash their dogs,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/02/chip-semiconductor-shortage-impact/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social,"Of all the businesses to suffer from the global shortage of computer chips, dog washing — a low-tech affair involving soap, water and a dirty pet — ought to be near the bottom of the list.But as with so many low-tech tasks these days, high-tech options are available, and that’s how CCSI International, a family-run manufacturer in rural Illinois, ran afoul of the chip shortage.CCSI makes electronic dog-washing booths that dispense shampoo, water and optional fur-drying. The machines are a hit with dog-park managers and the U.S. military, which buys them for use on its bases.But the machines are controlled by computer chips, and recently, CCSI, which assembles the booths at its factory in Garden Prairie, Ill., was told by its circuit-board supplier that the usual chips weren’t available. A substitute chip would work, but CCSI would have to tweak its circuit boards.That process has raised CCSI’s costs, bringing the frustrations of the same chip shortage that has idled auto factories around the world to a tiny town where the other main employers are a granary, a couple of bars and a part-time post office.“This particular problem affects all aspects of manufacturing, from little people to big conglomerates,” said company president Russell Caldwell, whose father founded the business in the 1960s to sell lawn mowers. “Literally we have corn fields around us. . . . There’s not a lot here.”Auto companies have been the most visible victims of the chip shortage, with Ford last week saying it expects to produce 1.1 million fewer vehicles this year than it had planned.General Motors and Ford halt production at more factories as global semiconductor shortage worsensBut in a testament to how dependent the world has become on the tiny silicon wafers, manufacturers of everything from video game consoles to household appliances are reporting problems. Apple said last week the supply pinch is hurting production of iPads and Mac computers and might cost it as much as $4 billion in sales, while Caterpillar warned of possible trouble ahead. Samsung said its sales of display panels are down because manufacturers who buy them for smartphones can’t get enough chips and have cut production.Even railways are complaining that they have fewer autos to haul around.The shortages threaten to act as a drag on the economy just as the post-pandemic recovery gets underway.“When the chip supply tightens, the whole economy suffers,” says Glenn O’Donnell, a tech analyst at market-research firm Forrester.Semiconductors are the brains behind most modern electronics, from computers and cellphones to smart toasters and washing machines. Cars, too, rely on dozens of semiconductors to operate dashboard displays, air bags and navigation systems.Increasingly, however, semiconductors are enabling high-tech solutions to low-tech problems, such as vacuuming a carpet or cleaning a litter box. Chip-enabled lightbulbs and thermostats can be turned on and off over a WiFi connection. Pet owners can track their pooches with GPS-powered dog tags. Doorbells tell you someone is at the door, even if you are miles (or continents) away.“Everything has chips in it now,” O’Donnell said. “We are instrumenting everything around us.”When the pandemic hit last year, demand for many chips soared even further as white-collar workers snapped up computers and monitors for use at home, and leaned on cloud-computing centers to support a surge in Zoom and Microsoft Teams meetings.Soaring demand and limited chip-manufacturing capacity worldwide means the shortages could last beyond 2022, until more semiconductor factories can be built, the chief executive of chip-making giant Intel said last month. The plants can cost more than $10 billion and take a few years to ramp up, a commitment that only a handful of companies worldwide have been willing to make.Because of the steep cost, most chip manufacturers have focused their investment in recent years on factories that make the highest-tech, most expensive semiconductors. That has left lower-tech chips — the kind that run dog-washing booths, car parts and many other goods — in particularly short supply.CCSI entered the dog-washing game about a decade ago, as a way to rustle up new business after the 2008 financial crisis. The company also manufacturers glass enclosures for carwashes, swimming pools and greenhouses.“We are a manufacturing company of wet environment structures,” Caldwell said.The strength of the pet market has made the dog booths a key growth-driver for CCSI. “A person takes their dog in there, they put the money in and the electronics of the circuit board operates the shampoo and counts the time and money,” Caldwell said.A few weeks ago, CCSI’s circuit-board supplier checked in with a problem: It couldn’t source the semiconductors it had been attaching to the boards that operate the dog-washing booths. It was able to find a similar chip that would work, but because the replacement chip was bigger the circuit-board maker",A family-run manufacturer in rural Illinois ran afoul of the chip shortage.

WP,Chip Shortage,6,"No chips, no tips: How the computer chip shortage threatens thousands of restaurant service jobs",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/06/11/restaurant-workers-computer-chip-shortage/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social,"A lack of chips, computer not tortilla, is wreaking havoc on the already beleaguered restaurant and bar industry, the latest victim of a pandemic-induced worldwide shortage that has disrupted the manufacturing of smartphones, cars and more.Computer chips are used in the systems that restaurants rely on to record customer meal orders and relay them to the kitchen. The chip shortage is creating headaches for existing restaurants and big barriers to entry for new restaurants.Called “point of sale” or POS machines, these systems connect servers’ handheld ordering devices to terminals and printers in the kitchen and dining room. At a moment when just about every restaurant in the country is short-staffed, not having enough handheld machines or terminals adds another layer of problems.Here’s an example. With summer weather prompting every restaurant to maximize outdoor space, servers who lack these ordering devices have to rush indoors to put in orders or add another round of drinks — with time ticking.What are Americans making for dinner? Reservations.“We’re scratching our heads. We’re back. We had 300,000 people here [in Las Vegas] this weekend,” says Doug Taylor, pastry chef for Jerry’s Nugget Casino. Diners are raring to go, but the computer chip shortage is slowing things down.“It’s backing up the flow of traffic, if you’re not able to process as many people as quickly,” Taylor says. “We were in a lull for a year, and now that everything is open 100 percent, it’s a giant bottleneck.”The companies that make the equipment are scrambling to come up with workarounds, like online payment and scannable tabletop codes that allow customers to order from their phones. For an industry that has been decimated and rebuilt during the coronavirus pandemic, the chip shortage could change the dining-out landscape, erasing thousands of server and bartender jobs forever.As his restaurants’ customers return, a Miami chef is missing a critical ingredient: WorkersWhile leisure and hospitality jobs increased by 292,000 in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the industry is still down more than 2 million from its pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, worker shortages have hit restaurants particularly hard, with former staffers changing careers, dealing with child-care challenges or avoiding such public-facing jobs amid health concerns.Many of those jobs could go unfilled  if customers start shouldering more of the work of placing orders and orchestrating payments.  Thanks to automation, artificial intelligence and robots, hospitality jobs could look a lot different with contactless ordering and payment becoming the norm.Tiny silicon wafers are the brains behind most modern electronics,  such as refrigerators,  smart toasters, washing machines and these restaurant ordering systems. The pandemic interrupted the supply chain for chips at time when demand for a lot of the goods that use them, especially cars, reached new heights.Biden can’t fix the chip shortage any time soon. Here’s why.PAX is one of the largest companies that make chip-dependent equipment for restaurants, with 60 million restaurant terminals that take food orders and payments globally. They also make the handheld ordering devices that waiters use. Clint Jones, PAX senior vice president of sales and operations in the United States, says that the company got through most of the pandemic with only minor hiccups from its  factories in China, but that began to change in April and May.“The chips were not getting delivered, as well as other electronic components,” he says. “The shortage is pervasive. I can’t imagine opening a small restaurant at this time — there are a lot of things going against you, and you’re swimming upstream.”The chip shortage is troubling restaurants large and small. Stone Brewing runs two huge bistros in San Diego and a third in Napa, as well as six taprooms in Southern California and Virginia. When the 1,000-seat bistro in San Diego got a new POS system a few weeks ago, it got 14 terminals and 30 handheld units for servers, which may sound like a lot, says Gregg Frazer, vice president of hospitality, but it isn’t nearly enough. He says he could use another 14 handhelds, at least. “We’ve gone to order more and we can’t get more. It’s undoubtedly had an impact.”Hiring troubles prompt some employers to eye automation and machinesMany restaurant managers are being caught unaware that the chip shortage affects them. Alex Levin, pastry chef and director of strategic business initiatives for the Schlow Restaurant Group based in D.C., says his restaurants use terminals and handhelds from a company called Toast, which has been walloped.“The general manager at Alta Strata [in Washington, D.C.,] said he needed to replace two of his handhelds. That’s normally easy to do. It’s just ‘click, click’ on the Toast website,” Levin says. “When I did that, I saw that everything was sold out.

Carmakers in years past largely used chips of older designs and left sourcing to their parts suppliers, which would buy the chips and build them into automotive components, such as power windows or dashboard displays. Often, car executives did not know much about where the chips came from, auto consultants say.That came to haunt them this year as coronavirus pandemic-related gyrations in chip supply and demand left automakers without enough semiconductors to build their vehicles, forcing them to suspend production for weeks at a time.Semiconductor shortage that has hobbled manufacturing worldwide is getting worseThe costs have been huge: The global auto industry will produce 7.7 million fewer vehicles this year because of the chip shortage, costing it $210 billion of revenue, according to consulting firm AlixPartners.The related collapse in auto sales to consumers shaved more than two percentage points from U.S. GDP growth in the third quarter.“It’s critical that we create new ways of working with suppliers to give Ford — and America — greater independence in delivering the technologies and features our customers will most value in the future,” Ford president and chief executive Jim Farley said in a statement.Ford doesn’t currently conduct chip-related research and development in-house but is working to develop that expertise, spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said.Though details are still in flux, “I think what we’re hoping to do is work together jointly on R & D for a specific chip made just for Ford’s needs,” she said. “And likely [Ford] would say to GlobalFoundries, ‘You guys have the manufacturing expertise, you should go and manufacture it.’”Any chips for Ford would likely be made at the GlobalFoundries factory in Malta, Hogan said.Semiconductors are the brains behind an increasing number of commonly used consumer devices, from smartphones and laptops to kitchen appliances, vacuum cleaners and automobiles.Three months, 700 steps: Why it takes so long to produce a computer chipIn recent decades, semiconductor technology largely evolved to fit the needs of the personal-computer industry, then cellphone and smartphone makers, Hogan said.Automakers were “sort of happy to benefit from whatever technology happened to have been created,” he said. “And they would find a way for their supply chain to use those devices to accomplish a different goal. So the same microcontroller that might have been in a toaster oven was modified to go in and move your window up and down.”But as the automotive industry develops a new generation of vehicles, including electric and autonomous cars, it has a greater need to design its own chips, Hogan said. Special semiconductors to manage power supply in battery-operated cars will be a top priority, he said.Tesla already designs its own semiconductors, he said, and other automakers will follow.Semiconductor shortage hammering automakers, costing billions in lost production and salesIn an interview this year, GlobalFoundries Chief Executive Tom Caulfield said the chipmaker was exploring deals with automakers that wanted to help finance expansion of chip production in exchange for secure supply. Hogan said the Ford deal does not preclude the chipmaker from working with other car companies.Chipmaking giant Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said earlier this year it was talking to automakers and auto-parts suppliers about steps it can take to increase automotive chip production. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for an update on Thursday.GlobalFoundries, majority-owned by the investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, which is separate from the United Arab Emirates’ government, runs large semiconductor factories in Malta, N.Y.; Dresden, Germany; and Singapore.In a statement Thursday, Caulfield called the deal “a key step forward in strengthening our cooperation and partnership with automakers to spur innovation, bring new features to market faster, and ensure long-term, supply-demand balance.”President Biden has labeled the chip shortage a “dangerous weak spot in our economy” and signed an executive order earlier this year seeking to address it.Semiconductors are in short supply in part because chip factories are so expensive to build.

Taiwan has shut off irrigation across tens of thousands of acres of farmland.Credit...An Rong Xu for The New York TimesSupported byBy Raymond Zhong and Amy Chang ChienHSINCHU, Taiwan — Chuang Cheng-deng’s modest rice farm is a stone’s throw from the nerve center of Taiwan’s computer chip industry, whose products power a huge share of the world’s iPhones and other gadgets.This year, Mr. Chuang is paying the price for his high-tech neighbors’ economic importance. Gripped by drought and scrambling to save water for homes and factories, Taiwan has shut off irrigation across tens of thousands of acres of farmland.The authorities are compensating growers for the lost income. But Mr. Chuang, 55, worries that the thwarted harvest will drive customers to seek out other suppliers, which could mean years of depressed earnings.“The government is using money to seal farmers’ mouths shut,” he said, surveying his parched brown fields.Officials are calling the drought Taiwan’s worst in more than half a century. And it is exposing the enormous challenges involved in hosting the island’s semiconductor industry, which is an increasingly indispensable node in the global supply chains for smartphones, cars and other keystones of modern life.Chip makers use lots of water to clean their factories and wafers, the thin slices of silicon that form the basis of the chips. And with worldwide semiconductor supplies already strained by surging demand for electronics, the added uncertainty about Taiwan’s water supply is not likely to ease concerns about the tech world’s reliance on the island and on one chip maker in particular: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.More than 90 percent of the world’s manufacturing capacity for the most advanced chips is in Taiwan and run by TSMC, which makes chips for Apple, Intel and other big names. The company said last week that it would invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase capacity, which will likely further strengthen its commanding presence in the market.TSMC says the drought has not affected its production so far. But with Taiwan’s rainfall becoming no more predictable even as its tech industry grows, the island is having to go to greater and greater lengths to keep the water flowing.In recent months, the government has flown planes and burned chemicals to seed the clouds above reservoirs. It has built a seawater desalination plant in Hsinchu, home to TSMC’s headquarters, and a pipeline connecting the city with the rainier north. It has ordered industries to cut use. In some places it has reduced water pressure and begun shutting off supplies for two days each week. Some companies, including TSMC, have hauled in truckloads of water from other areas.But the most sweeping measure has been the halt on irrigation, which affects 183,000 acres of farmland, around a fifth of Taiwan’s irrigated land.“TSMC and those semiconductor guys, they don’t feel any of this at all,” said Tian Shou-shi, 63, a rice grower in Hsinchu. “We farmers just want to be able to make an honest living.”In an interview, the deputy director of Taiwan’s Water Resources Agency, Wang Yi-feng, defended the government’s policies, saying the dry spell meant that harvests would be bad even with access to irrigation. Diverting scarce water to farms instead of factories and homes would be “lose-lose,” he said.When asked about farmers’ water troubles, a TSMC spokeswoman, Nina Kao, said it was “very important for each industry and company” to use water efficiently and pointed to TSMC’s involvement in a project to increase irrigation efficiency.That Taiwan, one of the developed world’s rainiest places, should lack for water is a paradox verging on tragedy.Much of the water used by residents is deposited by the summer typhoons. But the storms also send soil cascading from Taiwan’s mountainous terrain into its reservoirs. This has gradually reduced the amount of water that reservoirs can hold.The rains are also highly variable year to year. Not a single typhoon made landfall during last year’s rainy season, the first time that had happened since 1964.Taiwan last shut off irrigation on a large scale to save water in 2015, and before that in 2004.“If in another two or three years, the same conditions reappear, then we can say, ‘Ah, Taiwan has definitely entered an era of major water shortages,’” said You Jiing-yun, a civil engineering professor at National Taiwan University. “Right now, it’s wait and see.”In 2019, TSMC’s facilities in Hsinchu consumed 63,000 tons of water a day, according to the company, or more than 10 percent of the supply from two local reservoirs, Baoshan and Baoshan Second Reservoir. TSMC recycled more than 86 percent of the water from its manufacturing processes that year, it said, and conserved 3.6 million",Officials are calling the drought Taiwans worst in more than half a century.

That’s become a problem now that supplies are running short.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Don ClarkDan Rozycki, the president of a small engineering firm, worries about what a global semiconductor shortage could mean for curing concrete.Mr. Rozycki’s company, Transtec Group in Austin, Texas, sells small sensors that are placed where concrete is poured at building, highway and bridge construction sites. The gadgets take temperature readings and wirelessly send data so workers with computers can ensure the material is hardening properly.Like many other things in the modern world, from computers and cars to cash registers and kitchen appliances, the sensors require a couple of common, inexpensive semiconductors that have suddenly become a very scarce commodity.“Every month our product is getting more popular,” Mr. Rozycki said. “But we may not be able to make it in several months.”Shortages of semiconductors, fueled by pandemic interruptions and production issues at multibillion-dollar chip factories, have sent shock waves through the economy. Questions about chips are reverberating among both businesses and policymakers trying to navigate the world’s dependence on the small components.Chip supply limitations are far from a new phenomenon. But past problems have typically concerned particular kinds of chips, like the types that help store computer memory or process vast amounts of data. This time, customers are also scrambling to find an array of simpler chips made in older factories. And those factories are difficult to upgrade.President Biden in February ordered a 100-day review of the semiconductor supply chain, a process that drew chief executives of 19 big companies to a virtual meeting Monday. Congress has backed legislation aimed at spurring more domestic chip manufacturing to reduce dependence on Taiwan and South Korea, which Mr. Biden has proposed funding with $50 billion in his infrastructure plan.Most attention has focused on temporary closings of big U.S. car plants. But the problem is affecting many other sectors, particularly the server systems and PCs used to deliver and consume internet services that became crucial during the pandemic.“Every aspect of human existence is going online, and every aspect of that is running on semiconductors,” said Pat Gelsinger, the new chief executive of the chip maker Intel, who attended the meeting with the president on Monday. “People are begging us for more.”The chip shortage potentially affects just about any company adding communications or computing features to products. Many examples were described in 90 comments filed to the Biden supply chain review by companies and trade groups, including a laundry list of needs from industry giants like Amazon and Boeing.The personal computer giant HP said the shortage of semiconductors had prevented the company from being able to meet demand for computers ordered by schools. Rising chip prices also have made it harder to offer affordable hardware for less-wealthy school districts during the pandemic, the company said.Mr. Rozycki’s engineering firm in Austin is for now among the lucky chip users. It planned ahead and has enough chips to keep making the roughly 50,000 sensors it supplies each year to construction sites. But his distributor has warned him it might not be able to deliver more of them until late 2022, he said.“Is that going to halt those projects?” Mr. Rozycki asked. He is scouring the market for other distributors that might have the two needed chips in stock. Other possibilities include redesigning the sensors to use different chips.The supply problems are as multifaceted as the nearly $500 billion semiconductor business. Manufacturers turn silicon wafers to chips in complex processes using chemicals, gases and costly machines. Finished chips cross national boundaries dozens of times to partners that package, test and ship them to hardware makers and distributors.Shortages this year have been exacerbated by episodes that include a fire at a Renesas Electronics chip factory in Japan, a drought in Taiwan and a cold snap in Texas that temporarily shut down factories operated by Samsung Electronics, NXP Semiconductors and Infineon.“It’s hell on earth right now,” said Frank McKay, chief procurement officer at Jabil, which buys billions of dollars’ worth of chips each year to assemble products for customers that include Apple, Amazon, Cisco Systems and Tesla.On any given day, he said, his company is facing shortages of 100 or so components and has to use all its negotiating power to get them — successfully so far. “But it’s a roller-coaster ride every day,” Mr. McKay said.Fixing other issues is likely to stretch into 2022.

Anyone can read what you share.By Jack Ewing and Neal E. BoudetteAround the world, auto assembly lines are going quiet, workers are idle and dealership parking lots are looking bare.A shortage of semiconductors, the tiny but critical chips used to calibrate cars’ fuel injection, run infotainment systems or provide the brains for cruise control, has upended automaking.A General Motors plant in Kansas City closed in February for lack of chips, and still hasn’t reopened. Mercedes-Benz has begun to hoard its chips for expensive models and is temporarily shutting down factories that produce lower-priced C-Class sedans. Porsche warned dealers in the United States this month that customers might have to wait an extra 12 weeks to get their cars, because they lack a chip used to monitor tire pressure.The French automaker Peugeot, part of the newly formed Stellantis automaking empire, has gone so far as to substitute old-fashioned analog speedometers for digital units in some models.The disruption could not come at a worse time. Demand for cars has bounced back strongly from the pandemic slump, with consumers ready to spend money they saved over the past year, eager to avoid airplanes by taking road trips. The supply of semiconductors is depriving carmakers of a chance to make up sales they lost.“We have already a robust demand situation being more held back by the semiconductor issue than anything else,” Ola Källenius, the chief executive of Daimler, said in an interview.Some automakers, such as Renault, have begun to triage their chips, reserving them for more costly models that bring more profit. “We’re trying to find an intelligent way to prioritize cars with the higher margins,” Clotilde Delbos, Renault’s deputy chief executive, told analysts on Thursday.Some buyers may be lucky enough to take home a new car, but it may lack options that use specialized chips. Porsche has told U.S. dealers that for several months it won’t be able to deliver high-end seats in the Macan S.U.V. that can be adjusted 18 different ways, a popular upgrade. The necessary chips are unavailable.One big reason automakers can’t find enough chips is that semiconductor manufacturers have given priority to manufacturers of smartphones, video game consoles and other consumer electronics, which tend to be more lucrative customers.A modern car can easily have more than 3,000 chips. But cars account for a tiny share of chip demand. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is one of the few makers of a variety of chips vital to auto manufacturing, but in 2020 carmakers generated only 3 percent of the company’s sales, according to Roland Berger, a German consulting firm.TSMC’s most important customers are smartphone makers, which accounted for half of sales. Smartphones outnumber cars by a wide margin. In 2019, before the pandemic disrupted global economies, auto factories churned out 93 million vehicles compared with smartphone production of 1.4 billion units.Over all, the chip shortage and other supply chain snarls curtailed production by 1.3 million vehicles in the first three months of the year, according to IHS Markit, a consultancy.The problem has become a concern for political leaders in Washington and other capitals.Peter Altmaier, the German economics minister, recently appealed to his counterpart in Taiwan, a global center for semiconductor manufacturers, asking in so many words whether the Taiwanese minister couldn’t help shake loose a few chips urgently needed by German carmakers.The chip shortage “has become a serious problem for manufacturers, especially the auto industry,” a group of German economic research institutes warned in a joint report this month.The crisis has exposed not only how dependent the car industry is on a few suppliers, but also how vulnerable it is to disruptions. Supply chain managers shuddered last month when an early-morning fire knocked out production at a factory owned by Renesas Electronics in Hitachinaka, Japan, north of Tokyo. Renesas is a crucial supplier of chips used to monitor brake functioning, control power steering, trigger airbags and in many other tasks.Weather has also played a role. Storms in Texas earlier in the year temporarily forced the shutdown of three semiconductor factories. And Taiwan is in the midst of a severe drought, analysts at IHS Markit warned in a recent report. Chip manufacturing requires large amounts of very pure water.Even without a pandemic and supply chain disruptions, the auto industry is in turmoil.

Used cars are scarce, too.Credit...Andrea ChronopoulosSupported byBy Neal E. BoudetteRick Ricart is expecting nearly 40 Kia Telluride sport utility vehicles to arrive at his family’s dealership near Columbus, Ohio, over the next three weeks. Most will be on his lot for just a few hours.“They’re all sold,” Mr. Ricart said. “Customers have either signed the papers or have a deposit on them. The market is insane right now.”In showrooms across the country, Americans are buying most makes and models almost as fast as they can be made or resold. The frenzy for new and used vehicles is being fed by two related forces: Automakers are struggling to increase production because of a shortage of computer chips caused in large part by the pandemic. And a strong economic recovery, low interest rates, high savings and government stimulus payments have boosted demand.The combination has left dealers and individuals struggling to get their hands on vehicles. Some dealers are calling and emailing former customers offering to buy back cars they sold a year or two earlier because demand for used vehicles is as strong as it is for new cars, if not stronger. Used car prices are up about 45 percent over the past year, according to government data published this week. New car and truck prices are up about 5 percent over the past year.Those price increases have fed a debate in Washington about whether President Biden’s policies, particularly the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan he signed in March, are responsible for the sharp rise in inflation. The government said this week that consumer prices across the economy rose 5.4 percent in the last year through June.Republican lawmakers have argued that the March legislation is overheating the economy and are citing the rise in prices to oppose additional government spending. But Biden administration officials have pointed out that temporary supply shortages are largely responsible for the surge in prices of cars and other goods.Government stimulus may have helped some consumers, but it is hard to say how much. Several large forces are at play.The chip shortage, for example, is affecting automakers all over the world and is not directly related to U.S. policies. Industry officials blame limited production capacity for semiconductors and pandemic-related disruptions in supply and demand for the shortage.To make the most of limited chip supplies, General Motors has temporarily done away with certain features in some models, like stop-start systems that automatically turn off engines when cars stop for, say, a traffic light. And the French carmaker Peugeot has replaced digital speedometers with analog ones in some cars.Rental car companies that sold off thousands of cars during the pandemic to survive are now in the market to buy cars and trucks. They want to take advantage of a summer travel boom that has driven up rental rates to several hundred dollars a day in some places.“The industry has had strikes and material shortages before that have left us short of inventory, but I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Mark Scarpelli, the owner of two Chevrolet dealerships near Chicago. “Never, never, never.”His dealerships normally have 600 to 700 cars in stock. Now, he has about 50. Once or twice a week, a truck arrives with five or 10 vehicles. The cars disappear quickly because of customer waiting lists, Mr. Scarpelli said.Industry executives said the last time demand and supply were this out of sync was most likely after the end of World War II, when U.S. auto plants returned to making cars after years of churning out tanks and planes.Dealers said virtually everything was selling, from luxury vehicles and sports cars that cost more than $100,000 to basic used cars that many parents buy for teenagers.Even though the unemployment rate is still higher than before the pandemic, many people have money to spend. Government payments have helped lots of people, but many Americans, kept from vacationing or eating out, saved money. Financing cars is also relatively cheap — at least for people with good credit. Some automakers like Toyota, which has been less affected by the chip shortage than others, are advertising zero-interest loans on some cars.Mr. Ricart’s family businesses include a custom shop that sells high-end, special-edition trucks and sports cars. “We had a $125,000 Shelby pickup, and I said, ‘Who’s going to buy that?’” he recalled. “The next day it was gone. There’s so much free cash in the market. People are paying full price, even for the most expensive vehicles we have.”Buyers often have to take vehicles that don’t meet their specifications, and move fast when they find one close enough.Gary Werle, a retiree in Lake Worth, Fla., recently traded in a 2017 Buick Encore for a 2021 version, drawn by its safety features such as blind-spot monitoring and automatic braking. “I’m 80, and",A shortage of computer chips is keeping automakers from producing enough cars to meet rising demand.

BoudetteToyota Motor said on Friday that it will make about 40 percent fewer cars and trucks around the world in October as a result of complications from a shortage of computer chips and Covid-19 restrictions affecting the production of parts in Southeast Asia.It will be the second month in a row that Toyota, the world’s largest automaker by the number of cars and trucks sold, has slashed production because of the shortage and the pandemic. It is the latest sign that the auto industry could be hamstrung by the chip shortage well into 2022.In a statement, Toyota said it now expects to produce 330,000 fewer vehicles in October than it had previously planned. Its North American operations would likely see production lowered by 60,000 to 80,000 vehicles in October. The company also said global output in September would fall about 70,000 vehicles short of previously lowered production targets.“Key reasons for the production adjustment include a decline in operations at several local suppliers due to the prolonged spread of Covid-19 in Southeast Asia and the impact of tighter semiconductor supplies,” the automaker said. “Although our plants and suppliers are taking thorough quarantine and vaccination measures in response to the pandemic in Southeast Asia, the spread of Covid-19 infections remains unpredictable, making it difficult to maintain operations due to lockdowns at various locations.”For the fiscal year ending March 31, Toyota now expects to produce nine million cars and trucks, down from an earlier estimate of 9.3 million.Until recently, Toyota had weathered the chip shortage better than many other automakers because of its close ties with suppliers and its large stockpile of parts and components. Most automakers had forecast that the chip shortage would ease in the second half of this year. Yet, companies are still being forced to slow output and temporarily idle plants.Advertisement",Toyota says it will make about 40 percent fewer cars and trucks around the world in October.

Anyone can read what you share.By The New York TimesEven as more established automakers reported slowing sales because of supply constraints, Tesla said Saturday that it achieved a healthy increase in worldwide deliveries of its electric cars in the third quarter.The company said it delivered 241,300 vehicles in the three-month period, its highest quarterly total so far. It was a 20 percent increase from the second quarter and 73 percent higher than the total in last year’s third quarter.Tesla does not break out its deliveries by country. Much of its recent growth has been propelled by sales in Europe and China.On Friday, major automakers including General Motors and Toyota said they had suffered recent U.S. sales declines because of a worldwide shortage of semiconductors as the pandemic’s disruptions have caused factory shutdowns and cargo bottlenecks.In its brief announcement on Saturday, Tesla hinted that it had not been unscathed by those troubles. “We would like to thank our customers for their patience as we work through global supply chain and logistics challenges,” the company said.When the company announced its second-quarter earnings in July, its chief executive, Elon Musk, said it had weathered the shortage by switching to chips that were more readily available and writing new instructions to be embedded in the chips — known as firmware. But he also said Tesla had to idle some production for lack of parts.Tesla said the third-quarter delivery figures, the best proxy for its sales, were an initial count that “should be viewed as slightly conservative.”The company said it produced 237,823 vehicles in the quarter, of which 228,882 were either the Model 3 or its roomier version, the Model Y. It made 8,941 of its most profitable vehicles, the Model S luxury sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle, only slightly more than half the total in the period a year ago.Production of the Model S and Model X was halted for a time this year while Tesla prepared its plant in Fremont, Calif., to build updated versions.Though far outsold by more established companies, Tesla is the most highly valued automaker in the world, with a market capitalization of more than $770 billion. But it faces new competition as electric vehicles go from a niche to the mainstream.Rivian, an American electric truck maker with more than $10 billion in investments from Amazon, Ford Motor and several Wall Street firms, filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday ahead of an initial public offering.And Lucid Motors, headed by a former Tesla executive, Peter Rawlinson, has said it will soon start delivering a luxury sedan capable of traveling up to 520 miles on a single charge of its battery pack, about 100 miles farther than the longest-range Tesla model.Advertisement",Tesla has weathered the global shortage of semiconductors better than more established rivals.

BoudetteFord Motor said Monday that its sales of new vehicles in the United States fell about 27 percent in the three months that ended in September from the same period a year earlier. The drop was in line with the rest of the auto industry, which has been hampered by a global shortage of computer chips.Ford was forced to idle many of its plants for parts of August and September because it did not have enough electronic parts that use computer chips to control components such as engines, transmissions and displays. The disruptions left dealers with few cars and trucks to sell.In the quarter, Ford sold about 400,000 light trucks and cars, down from about 550,000 a year ago. General Motors on Friday reported that its third quarter U.S. sales fell 33 percent. Honda’s sales fell 11 percent and Chrysler’s 19 percent. Toyota reported its sales rose slightly during the quarter, but its total for September declined 22 percent.But Ford said the supply of parts was improving, as was its inventory of new cars and trucks. It reported having 235,700 cars at the end of September, up from 162,100 at the end of June.Ford’s lowered sales total resulted in a rare setback.

Demand for Microchip’s products is running more than 50 percent higher than it can supply. That has put the company, based in Chandler, Ariz., in an unfamiliar position of power, which it began wielding this year.While Microchip normally lets customers cancel a chip order within 90 days of delivery, it began offering shipment priority to clients that signed contracts for 12 months of orders that couldn’t be revoked or rescheduled. These commitments reduced the chances that orders would evaporate when the scarcity ended, giving Microchip more confidence to safely hire workers and buy costly equipment to increase production.“It gives us the ability to not hold back,” said Ganesh Moorthy, president and chief executive of Microchip, which on Thursday reported that profit in the latest quarter tripled and that sales rose 26 percent to $1.65 billion.Such contracts are just one example of how the $500 billion chip industry is changing because of the silicon shortage, with many of the shifts likely to outlive the pandemic-fueled dearth. The lack of the tiny components — which has pinched makers of cars, game consoles, medical devices and many other goods — has been a stark reminder of the foundational nature of chips, which act as the brains of computers and other products.Chief among the changes is a long-term shift in market power from chip buyers to sellers, particularly those that own factories that make the semiconductors. The most visible beneficiaries have been giant chip manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which offer services called foundries that build chips for other companies.But the shortage has also sharply bolstered the influence of lesser-known chip makers such as Microchip, NXP Semiconductors, STMicroelectronics, Onsemi and Infineon, which design and sell thousands of chip varieties to thousands of customers. These companies, which build many products in their own aging factories, now are increasingly able to choose which customers get how many of their scarce chips.Many are favoring buyers who act more like partners, by taking steps like signing long-term purchase commitments or investing to help chip makers increase production. Above all, the chip makers are asking clients to share more information earlier about which chips they will need, which helps guide decisions about how to lift manufacturing.“That visibility is what we need,” said Hassane El-Khoury, chief executive of the chip maker Onsemi, a company previously known as ON Semiconductor.Many of the chip makers said they were using their new power with restraint, helping customers avoid problems like factory shutdowns and raising prices modestly. That’s because gouging customers, they said, could cause bad blood that would hurt sales when shortages end.Even so, the power shift has been unmistakable. “Today there is no leverage” for buyers, said Mark Adams, chief executive of Smart Global Holdings, a major user of memory chips.Marvell Technology, a Silicon Valley company that designs chips and outsources the manufacturing, has experienced the change in power. While it used to give foundries estimates of its chip production needs for 12 months, it began providing them with five-year forecasts starting in April.“You need a really good story,” said Matt Murphy, Marvell’s chief executive. “Ultimately the supply chain is going to allocate to who they think are going to be the winners.”It’s a substantial change in psychology for a mature industry where growth has generally been slow. Many chip makers for years sold largely interchangeable products and often struggled to keep their factories running profitably, particularly if sales slumped for items like personal computers and smartphones that drove most chip demand.But the components are essential for more products now, one of many signs that rapid growth may linger. In the third quarter, total chip sales surged nearly 28 percent to $144.8 billion, the Semiconductor Industry Association said.Years of industry consolidation has also wrung out excess manufacturing capacity and left fewer suppliers selling exclusive kinds of chips. So buyers that could once place and cancel orders with little notice — and play one chip maker off another to get lower prices — have less muscle.One effect of these changes was to make chip factories more valuable, including some older ones owned by ","Low-cost chip makers with aging factories have become surprisingly powerful, leading to industry changes that may outlive the pandemic-fueled supply crunch",Little finger was Right Chaos is a ladder,"The global chip shortage  which has pinched makers of cars, game consoles and more  has bolstered the influence of low-profile chip makers, leading to industry changes that may outlive the flandemic-fueled supply crunch.",Positive Anticipation,Neutral Disgust Anger,Company looks to expand to fill in Chip Shortage void

Lynch3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Friday it would investigate the rising tide of hate crimes in America, as Asian Americans have experienced a growing number of racially motivated attacks since former President Donald Trump began referring to COVID-19 as a “China virus.”“The United States is currently facing unprecedented challenges, some of which are fueling increased bigotry and hatred,” said Pamela Karlan, the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division.She added that her office is working with the FBI, federal prosecutors and local police to “evaluate possible hate crimes,” without providing further details.A Justice Department official told Reuters the statement was a direct response to the increasing reports of violence against Asian Americans.Later, in a news briefing, Acting Deputy Attorney General John Carlin also addressed the issue, calling attacks on Asian Americans “horrific.”“I want to be clear here: No one in America should fear violence because of who they are, or what they believe,” he said.“We will not tolerate any form of domestic terrorism or hate-based violent extremism, and we are committed to putting a stop to it.”From March of 2020 to December of last year, there were more than 2,800 reported incidents of anti-Asian hate incidents in the United States, according to Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition that has been collecting data.While verbal harassment has made up more than 70 percent of the incidents, more than 8 percent involved physical assaults.In one such example, a surveillance video that has since gone viral showed a 91-year-old Asian man in Oakland, California, being shoved to the ground on Jan. 31.A suspect in the attack was later arrested, and now faces multiple assault charges for a number of Chinatown incidents. Prosecutors are also investigating whether the attacks were racially motivated.Another high-profile example includes the January murder of Vichar Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old immigrant from Thailand who was shoved to the ground in San Francisco and never regained consciousness after the fall.San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin has since charged a suspect in Ratanapakdee’s death.Reporting by Sarah N.

This is not the time to let up. Just as we are emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules,” he said.Republicans swiftly criticized Biden for his cautious approach. “What America needs now is to fully reopen our economy and our classrooms,” House of Representatives Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said on Twitter.Related CoverageBiden said he was ordering U.S. states, territories and tribes to make all adults eligible to receive a coronavirus vaccine by May 1. The White House has said it would have enough vaccine supply to vaccinate the adult population by the end of May. About 10% of Americans so far have been fully vaccinated.Administration officials said he would deploy 4,000 more troops to help with the vaccine effort, bringing the total number to 6,000. The White House is also seeking to expand the pool of people able to administer shots to include dentists, optometrists, paramedics, veterinarians and medical students.Biden campaigned last year on a promise that he would tackle the pandemic more effectively than Republican President Donald Trump, and he has sought to encourage and model behavior, such as mask-wearing, that Trump eschewed.In his speech, Biden took a swipe at his predecessor by saying the virus was initially met with “denials for days, weeks, then months, that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, more loneliness.”Biden said hate crimes and harassment against Asian Americans must stop. Trump repeatedly referred to the disease as the “China virus.”Biden also encouraged Americans to keep up mitigation efforts - wearing masks, keeping social distance and practicing good hygiene - to stop the virus and its variants from spreading. A number of states have been loosening restrictions as Americans, like many people around the world, grow weary of pandemic life.“Photos and videos from 2019 feel like they were taken in another era. The last vacation. The last birthday with friends. The last holiday with extended family,” Biden said, recounting the toll the virus has wrought.He said the country would come away from the crisis stronger. “We faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this nation’s history - darkest we’ve ever known,” he said.Earlier in the day, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan, designed to be a financial bridge to hard-hit Americans and a boost to the economy, in the Oval Office with Vice President Kamala Harris at his side. The $1.9 trillion package is a major political victory for the Democratic president fewer than two months into his administration.Biden and top members of his administration will embark on a victory lap in the coming weeks to laud and explain the legislation, which got final approval from the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday.The package provides $400 billion for $1,400 direct payments to most Americans, $350 billion in aid to state and local governments, an expansion of the child tax credit and increased funding for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The bill passed without a single vote from Republicans, who complained the price tag was too high.Coronavirus-related lockdowns and restrictions have cost millions of jobs, and Biden is focused on confronting the economic fallout. Direct deposits from the legislation would come as early as this weekend, the White House said.Biden will discuss the benefits of the pandemic relief bill during trips to Pennsylvania and Georgia next week.The lockdown from COVID-19 began under Trump, who played down the crisis in its early stages while repeatedly predicting the virus would soon disappear even as his administration pushed to speed up vaccine development.The former president and his wife, Melania Trump, did not appear in a public service announcement released on Thursday encouraging COVID-19 vaccinations and featuring all of the other living forme",President Joe Biden tells states to make all adults eligible for coronavirus vaccine by May 1.

Reuters,Asian Hate,3,"Biden deplores rising anti-Asian violence, asks Americans to stand together against hate",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2BB0ZY,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Trevor Hunnicutt, Nandita Bose6 Min ReadATLANTA (Reuters) - President Joe Biden deplored a surge in anti-Asian violence in the United States after a deadly shooting rampage in Georgia, and asked all Americans to stand together against hate during a visit to the state on Friday.Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris met for more than an hour with leaders and state lawmakers from the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community, which has been rattled by this week’s murders of eight people, including six women of Asian descent, after a year of rising anti-Asian violence.“Hate can have no safe harbor in America. It must stop. And it is on all of us, all of us together, to make it stop,” Biden said after the meeting, calling on U.S. lawmakers to pass a COVID-19 hate crimes bill that would expand Justice Department review of hate crimes exacerbated by the pandemic.Harris, the first Asian-American vice president in U.S. history, tied the violence to the long history of racism in the United States and likened it to the targeting of Muslims after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.“Racism is real in America, and it has always been. Xenophobia is real in America, and always has been. Sexism, too,” Harris said. “The president and I will not be silent. We will not stand by. We will always speak out against violence, hate crimes and discrimination wherever and whenever it occurs.”A 21-year-old man has been charged with Tuesday’s murders at three spas in and around Atlanta. Investigators said the suspect, who is white, suggested that sexual frustration led him to commit violence. But political leaders and civil rights advocates have speculated the killings were motivated at least in part by anti-Asian sentiment.Advocates say the surge of attacks on Asian Americans is largely the result of the community being targeted over the coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.On Friday, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the violence was exacerbated by language used by former President Donald Trump, who repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the “China virus” and the “kung flu.”Biden ordered the U.S. flag flown at half-staff at the White House to honor the victims of the Atlanta area shootings.The meeting with Asian-American community leaders was a shift in focus of a trip originally planned to promote the newly enacted $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.Asian-American voters constitute one of the fastest growing racial and ethnic groups in the country and turned out in record numbers in presidential battleground states in the 2020 election, according to data from TargetSmart, a Democratic political data firm.In Georgia, Asian-American and Pacific Islander voters exceeded their total 2016 turnout by 58%, the firm said. These voters were key to carrying Biden to success in states where the race was close such as Georgia, the firm said.As he headed to Georgia, Biden stumbled as he climbed aboard Air Force One. White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters he was “doing 100 percent fine” and suggested high winds at Joint Base Andrews near Washington may have been a factor.The Democratic president’s trip was initially part of the “Help is Here” campaign, which he kicked off on Monday to promote his promise of “shots in arms and money in pockets,” after signing the COVID-19 relief bill into law last week. Biden has traveled to Pennsylvania and Harris has been to Nevada and Colorado to tout the benefits of the package.Before they met with Asian-American leaders, Biden and Harris received a coronavirus update at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention where they thanked health officials for their effort fighting the pandemic.“This is a war and you are the frontline troops,” Biden said. “We owe you a debt of gratitude for all the lives you’ve saved.”In his remarks after meeting with community leaders, Biden touted the COVID-19 relief bill’s benefits for Georgia, saying the state’s schools will get $4 billion and state government $5 billion.“That’s going to make it possible to keep a lot of police officers, firefighters, teachers and other first responders on the job,” he said.Harris and Biden also met with Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia gubernatorial candidate whose get-out-the vote efforts are widely credited with helping Biden carry the state last November and their fellow Democrats win two runoffs in Georgia that gave them control of the U.S. Senate.“If anyone ever wondered if voting can change a country, Georgia just proved it can,” he said. But he warned the battle for voting rights was not over.A bill passed by the Republican-controlled Georgia House of Representatives this month would restrict ballot drop boxes, tighten absentee voting requirements and limit early voting on Sundays, curtailing traditional “Souls to the Polls” voter turnout programs in Black churches.Biden and Harris also met U.S. Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossof",Joe Biden and Kamala Harris met for more than an hour with Asian-American leaders.

Lynch, Valerie Volcovici4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth on Sunday expressed doubts about FBI Director Chris Wray’s initial assessment that the fatal shooting of six Asian women in Atlanta-area spas may not constitute a hate crime, saying it “looks racially motivated.”“From where I sit, I want to see a deeper investigation into whether or not these shootings and other similar crimes are racially motivated,” Duckworth, who is one of only two Asian-Americans currently serving in the U.S. Senate, told CBS “Face the Nation.”“It looks racially motivated to me,” she said, adding the caveat that she is not a police officer or personally investigating the crimes.Police in Atlanta are still investigating the motive in connection with the fatal shooting of eight people, six of whom were Asian women, on Tuesday. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is assisting with the investigation.In an interview with NPR last week, Wray said that it “does not appear” that race factored into the mass shooting.Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” also questioned that assessment, suggesting he believes race played a role.“We all know hate when we see it,” he said. “It is tragic that we’ve been visited by this kind of violence yet again.”The shootings have stoked fears among those in the Asian-American Pacific Islander community, which has reported a spike in hate crimes since March 2020 when then-President Donald Trump began referring to COVID-19 as the “China virus.”Suspected gunman Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old Atlanta-area resident who is white, told police that sexual frustration led him to commit the violence.Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office Captain Jay Baker, who told the media in a press conference that a sexual addiction may have fueled the crime and said Long had had “a really bad day,” has since come under criticism from political leaders and civil rights advocates for making insensitive comments. They noted such remarks only fuel stigmas about race, gender and sex work.The sheriff’s office later acknowledged the remarks had sparked anger, but said Baker never intended to offend anyone. Baker is no longer serving as a spokesman for the case.The incidence of hate crimes against Asian-Americans rose by 149% in 2020 in 16 major cities compared with 2019, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.Duckworth is among a growing number of Asian-American lawmakers who have urged law enforcement to more carefully examine the escalating violence.“It looks to me that he knew he was going to places where disproportionately the people he shot up would be Asians, and female, and I think the investigators need to really look at these facts,” Representative Ted Lieu, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told CNN last week, referring to Long.President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris visited Atlanta on Friday to offer support to Asian-Americans and meet with leaders of the community.Biden on Sunday also highlighted the need to prevent gender-based violence and keep women safe.“In the past few weeks, we’ve seen too many examples of horrific and brutal assaults on women, including the tragic murders in Georgia...It hurts all of us, and we all must do more to create societies where women are able to go about their lives free from violence,” he said in a statement.The Justice Department has previously said it will step up investigations into hate crimes against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders.Duckworth said on Sunday she has written a letter to Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland asking them to take a deeper look at whether hate crimes are going under-reported.A Justice Department spokesman confirmed receiving the letter and said it was under review.Reporting by Sarah N. Lynch and Valerie Volcovici; additional reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",Tammy Duckworth said the FBI Director Chris Wray's initial assessment that the fatal shooting may not constitute a hate crime may not be racially motivated.,"When you single out Asian-American women to kill, of course it’s racially motivated.

Elliot, who was on lifetime parole after serving a prison term for murdering his mother, was arrested without incident at his residence in New York City on Tuesday, police said.The New York Times identified the victim of the attack as Vilma Kari, an immigrant from the Philippines, citing a law enforcement source. An NYPD spokesman declined to confirm her identity. According to the Times, Kari suffered a fractured pelvis.“We want to extend our sincere well wishes and speedy recovery to the elderly lady for this unnecessary assault,” Wellington Chen, executive director of New York City’s Chinatown Partnership, said on Wednesday. “Hope this arrest gives her and her family a bit of relief.”There has been an increase in hate crimes reported against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Former President Donald Trump often referred to the coronavirus as the “China virus” and the “China plague.”Such crimes rose by 149% in 2020 in 16 major cities compared with 2019, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.Concern over anti-Asian hate crimes was heightened when six Asian women were among eight people fatally shot this month at Atlanta-area spas. A 21-year-old man was charged with the murders. Police have yet to determine a motive.President Joe Biden’s administration on Tuesday announced a set of measures responding to anti-Asian violence in the United States, including deploying $49.5 million from COVID-19 relief funds for U.S. community programs that help victims.In Monday’s attack in New York, a security video showed witnesses inside the lobby of a building apparently watching the assault but making no effort to help the woman. One man closed the front door while the attacker walked away.The Brodsky Organization, which owns and operates the building, said it has suspended two employees while it and an employees’ union investigate their response to the attack.“We take this situation very seriously, and are committed to strengthening internal training, and working with our community to ensure the safety of our residents and neighbors,” the Brodsky Organization said in a statement.“Had the men watching stepped in, I believe it would’ve helped the woman a lot,” New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. “We need to be the ones leading and doing something to help, not standing by or closing the door on someone.”New York police also are investigating an assault last week on a subway train against a young man who appeared to be Asian. The attack was captured on another widely viewed video.

And so the biggest hurdle will just be having stamina, but some journeys are worth taking,"" Willis said, adding she came to the decision after spending time with the families of the victims and reviewing the evidence.A lawyer for Long did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In March, Long told investigators a sex addiction drove him to commit the killings and indicated he frequented spas in the area. Authorities initially declined to name racial animosity as the motive for the massacre, which sent shock waves through the Asian-American community, already rattled by a rise in hate crimes since the COVID-19 pandemic began.Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition that has tracked rising anti-Asian violence during the pandemic, commended the prosecutor's characterization of the shootings as hate crimes, calling it ""important"" and stressing the broader need to address ""the combination of racism and misogyny Asian American women experience"" in the United States.The bloodshed began with four people killed and another wounded at Young's Asian Massage in Cherokee County. Two Asian-American women were among the dead there, along with a white woman and a white man.An hour later in Atlanta, police officers responding to a robbery report arrived at the Gold Spa beauty salon to find three women shot dead.

Police said the four suspects attacked the 51-year-old victim on an MTA bus in the Bronx.

One of the suspects struck the woman's head with an umbrella before all four of them fled the bus, police said. The woman received stitches for a cut on her head at a local hospital, the NYPD said in a statement. Shortly after the incident, officers arrested three15-year-old girls near the scene. The teens were charged with hate crime assaults, menacing and harassment for the attack, the NYPD said.

CNN's Ganesh Setty contributed to this report.Since March 21, there have been 21 reported anti-Asian hate crimes that have resulted in 17 arrests, according to Harrison, which he said is higher than normal.Victims have been reluctant to speak with police during investigations, he said, because of language barriers, cultural differences and fear of the police. In May, Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo proposed the creation of an anti-Asian hate crime task force, hoping that through a dedicated team they could build a better rapport with the community. The team includes 25 Asian American officers that speak a second language, Loo said. Not having to use translators will increase investigators' ability to develop relationships with victims and ultimately lead to more cooperation, he continued. Harrison noted that 4 of the 17 arrests were done with the help of the task force. ""This task force has been built and will continue to build trust and understanding between the NYPD and with Asian New Yorkers,"" said Harrison. The task force will be permanent, Harrison said, and other culture-based task forces may be considered in the future. When asked about why there wasn't a dedicated task force for anti-Semitic crimes, Harrison said that this task force was put together because of Asian Americans' lack of reporting and cooperation with the police. Victims of anti-Semitic crimes work with the police in most cases, he said. ""Since January, before COVID-19 became a national crisis, Asian Americans in New York City have been targeted in unprovoked racist attacks. They have been berated while riding the subway and harassed walking down the street,"" said Thomas Yu, co-executive director of Asian Americans for Equality, in a statement CNN. ""We applaud the city's decision to create an Asian Hate Crimes Task Force, a move that is long overdue...  At the same time, far more needs to be done. There is a critical need for resources at every level of government to fight hate crimes wherever they occur.""JoAnn Yoo, executive director of the Asian American Federation, also welcomed the announcement in a statement to CNN, adding, ""we also believe in restorative justice principles that intervene before hate crimes happen, which include building community within neighborhoods, getting neighbors to look out for each other, and investing in social safety net programs that deal with the stresses in the community that propel people to lash out at each other.""",The New York Police Department announced the creation of an Asian Hate Crime Task Force after an increase in racist attacks during the Covid-19 pandemic,Y’all still discriminate Asians from college through.

But, we can't solve a problem without knowing how big it is,"" said Assemblymember Phil Ting of San Francisco and chair of the state's budget committee.The funds will support the work of researchers at the Asian American Studies Center at the University of California Los Angeles as well as several initiatives including the Stop AAPI Hate website, which began collecting reports of racism and discrimination against Asian Americans on March 19 last year.Ting said he hopes the new state funding will ""lead us to solutions that will make all communities safer.""Since the Covid-19 pandemic began spreading in the United States, advocates and authorities have received reports of thousands of xenophobic attacks against Asian people. In California, several people have been violently shoved, robbed and left severely injured in recent weeks.From March to the end of 2020, the Stop AAPI Hate website received more than 2,800 firsthand reports of anti-Asian hate across 47 states and Washington, DC, according to data released earlier this month. The majority of those incidents -- about 71% -- were cases of verbal harassment, while shunning or avoidance made up about 21%. About 9% of the incidents involved physical assaults, and 6% included being purposely coughed or spit on, according to a Stop AAPI Hate news release.The funding allocated by California lawmakers will support the data collection and the advocacy efforts done by a coalition of organizations involved in the initiative, including offering resources to those directly to impacted by the attacks.""In the past year, we have seen that it is absolutely critical to invest in tracking the number of hate incidents against Asian Americans that are taking place. Documenting and analyzing the attacks — both in California and across the country — has enabled us to draw attention to this crisis, ensure that our community is not ignored, and advocate on its behalf,"" the Stop AAPI Hate Coalition said in a statement.'Horrific' and 'senseless' actsThe announcement comes nearly a week after a man left a dead cat at an Asian American woman's butcher shop in Sacramento. Police are now investigating it as a hate crime. Owner Kelly Shum told CNN's Brianna Keilar that a customer saw ""this terrible looking cat"" in the parking lot of her family business, Mad Butcher Meat Company, in Sacramento.Shum says she initially thought the animal was roadkill but ""it was very obvious that someone had left the cat there, the cat's body was so mangled that it was obvious that it was meant to send a message, that it was meant to be seen.""The person in the shop's surveillance video seen dumping the cat on February 22 matches video of a man who recently patronized the business. Shum says the man left her a message after ""seeing his face all over the news and he claims that he turned himself into the police but that nothing happened, which was extremely disappointing."" She plans to follow up with the man and the Sacramento Police Department (SPD).The family posted a security guard at the store which Shum acknowledges is unusual for such a shop but points to this kind of behavior against Asians as a primary reason. She teared up as she spoke about her employees who are mostly Chinese, like her family. When her sister was enforcing mask-wearing, someone tried to attack her.

Elliot was charged with two counts of second degree assault as a hate crime and one count of first degree attempted assault as a hate crime.Elliot is facing 25 years in prison in addition to ""other consequences related to his lifetime parole"" if convicted, Vance added. The judge ordered Elliot remain in custody. His next court date is April 5. The NYPD said Elliot is the man in the photos and videos released Tuesday by the department in its request to identify the individual near the scene Monday.In a statement to CNN, The Legal Aid Society, which is representing Elliot, asked that the public reserve judgment on its client ""until all the facts are presented in court.""""Mr. Elliot has a constitutional right to counsel and due process.

The woman is of Filipino descent, the complaint states.

CNN's Ted Barrett and Ali Zaslav contributed to this report.The vote was 94-1. The lone vote in opposition was from Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley.The bill would also direct the departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to issue guidance raising awareness of hate crimes during the pandemic, and work with agencies to establish online reporting of them.  It now goes to the House before being signed into law by President Joe Biden.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday that the bill is ""proof"" that ""the Senate can work to solve important issues,"" and would tell bigots ""we're going after you.""The bill, sponsored by New York Democratic Rep. Grace Meng and Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono, gained momentum after the shootings of six Asian women in Atlanta on March 16 drew even more attention to the rise of anti-Asian violence over the past year.Some Republicans were initially skeptical about the legislation known as the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act but Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins and others teamed up with Hirono to strike an agreement broadening its support. Hirono said Thursday that the bill's passage ""sends a clear and unmistakable message of solidarity"" to the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. Collins said it ""affirms our commitment to stand with"" them against hate crimes.In a tweet Thursday evening, Hawley explained that his opposition stemmed from what he called ""big free speech questions"" raised by the legislation. ""My big problem with Sen Hirono's bill that Senate voted on today is that it turns the federal government into the speech police - gives government sweeping authority to decide what counts as offensive speech and then monitor it,"" he said. Hirono and other Democrats have also pressured Biden to include more Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in top roles. Biden has since named Erika Moritsugu, a former official at the National Partnership for Women & Families and counsel to Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, as a liaison to the AAPI community.Of the 23 Cabinet-level positions requiring Senate consideration, Biden nominated two Asian Americans: Katherine Tai for trade representative and Neera Tanden for Office of Management and Budget director. Tai, the daughter of immigrants from Taiwan, was confirmed as the first woman of color to be the top US trade negotiator. But Tanden's nomination failed after West Virginia Sen.

WP,Asian Hate,1,Attacks on Asian Americans during pandemic renew criticism that U.S. undercounts hate crimes,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/asian-american-hate-crimes/2021/02/21/c28a8e04-72d9-11eb-b8a9-b9467510f0fe_story.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=wp_main,"A spate of high-profile assaults on Asian Americans has renewed long-standing criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups that the U.S. government is vastly undercounting hate crimes, a problem that they say has grown more acute amid rising white nationalism and deepening racial strife. The attacks — including several in Northern California over the past month that attracted national attention — followed months of warnings from advocates that anti­-China rhetoric from former president Donald Trump over the coronavirus pandemic was contributing to a surge in anti-Asian slurs and violence.Although President Biden last month signed an executive action banning the federal government from employing the sort of “inflammatory and xenophobic” language Trump used to describe the virus — such as “China plague” and “kung flu” — Asian American leaders said the recent attacks demonstrate a need for greater urgency in dealing with such threats.Among other incidents, Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old San Francisco resident who had emigrated from Thailand, was killed in late January, in a brazen attack captured on a video that went viral on social media. Antoine Watson, a 19-year-old African American man, was charged in connection with Ratanapakdee’s death and has pleaded not guilty.Biden administration officials said they are working to address the problem, pointing to a section in the executive memo that instructed the Justice Department to expand its reporting, tracking and prosecutions of “hate incidents.” Officials said those efforts could go beyond hate crimes to include episodes of harassment and discrimination.During his Senate confirmation hearing Monday, Merrick Garland, Biden’s nominee for attorney general, pledged to support such efforts.“Hate crimes tear at the fabric of our society. They make our citizens worried about walking the streets and exercising even the most normal rights,” Garland said. “The role of the [Justice Department’s] Civil Rights Division is to prosecute those cases vigorously, and I can ensure you that it will if I am confirmed.”A 1990 federal law mandates that the FBI collect data specifically on hate crimes each year, but the effort has long been plagued by incomplete and inconsistent data provided by the nation’s estimated 18,000 state, municipal and tribal law enforcement agencies.The administration is in the early stages of identifying strategies to compel broader participation. Among the ideas advocates have pushed for is tying federal funding from the Justice Department’s extensive grant programs to increased training and reporting on hate crimes.In 2019, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a report recommending Congress adopt legislation to provide funding for incentives and calling on local police to establish dedicated hate-crime units. Catherine E. Lhamon, who chaired that commission, now serves as deputy director for racial justice and equity on the White House domestic policy council.At a news conference last week, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), chair of the Asian Pacific American Caucus, said she is requesting a meeting with Justice Department leaders to discuss what she called a “crisis point” for the Asian American community in dealing with “an alarming surge of anti-Asian bigotry across the nation.”Chu added that the 1990 law on reporting of hate crime data “doesn’t have any teeth” because it does not compel localities to comply or to do so in a consistent and thorough manner.Last fall, the FBI reported 7,314 hate crimes nationwide in 2019, the most in a decade — but experts said the statistics were woefully inadequate because too few local law enforcement agencies fully participate in federal data collection efforts.The FBI said that 15,588 law enforcement organizations participated in the 2019 hate crimes study, but just 2,172 agencies reported the total number of incidents contained in the report. Civil rights advocates called that scenario implausible, pointing out that the entire state of Alabama reported no hate crimes to the FBI in both 2018 and 2019.“The FBI reports help us identify trends, but their data is so woefully inadequate that it can’t be relied on for much,” said civil rights lawyer Arjun Singh Sethi, author of “American Hate: Survivors Speak Out.”Some big-city law enforcement agencies have publicly reported an increase in bias attacks against Asian Americans. For example, New York City’s hate crimes task force investigated 27 incidents in 2020, including 24 tied to the coronavirus, a ninefold increase from the previous year.But experts said local police agencies lack training and funding to properly investigate hate crimes, and many treat it as a low priority. Some conservative Republicans have opposed more stringent reporting requirements to determine whether crimes are motivated by hate, arguing that such measures are redundant.Yet advocates have pointed to a 2013 study from the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics that found an av",A spate of high-profile assaults on Asian Americans has renewed long-standing criticism.

WP,Asian Hate,2,"Raised to identify as Black, Harris steps into role as a voice for Asian Americans amid rise in hate incidents",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/kamala-harris-asian-americans/2021/03/27/46efd156-8e3a-11eb-a6bd-0eb91c03305a_story.html?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_source=twitter,"Vice President Harris was in Atlanta to meet with community leaders in the wake of the mass shooting two weeks ago when she summoned top aides to discuss what she would say.Her speechwriter had called in from Washington. Others were seated in front of her in a semicircle. The attacker had killed eight, including six women of Asian descent, and a draft of Harris’s speech had focused on the need for everyone to feel safe.“That’s true, but it’s more than that,” she told the aides, according to one person familiar with the conversation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting. “It’s about being seen as American and not as the other.”A short time later, after emerging from the meeting with local Asian American leaders, Harris told reporters: “Sadly, it’s not new. Racism is real in America, and it has always been. Xenophobia is real in America, and it always has been. Sexism, too.” With President Biden standing behind her, she ticked through laws discriminating against Chinese immigrants in the 1860s, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and attacks against Muslim Americans after 9/11.“Ultimately, this is about who we are as a nation,” Harris said. Asians “have the right to be recognized as American — not as the ‘other,’ not as ‘them,’ but as ‘us.’ ”For Harris, the use of the collective pronoun was poignant. Though her late mother was an immigrant from India, Harris, 56, whose father is from Jamaica, was raised to identify as Black — a reflection of her mother’s recognition that a young biracial woman would be viewed that way in a society whose racial dialogue was defined principally through a lens of Black and White.Now, amid accounts of rising violence targeting Asian Americans, it is her South Asian heritage that has put Harris in a unique position to give voice to the pain and anger that inspired a nascent political movement.People who have worked with her said that Harris — although she seldom talks publicly about her Indian background — has an authentic understanding of the trepidation felt by many Asian Americans and shares their sense of urgency. The question, they said, is how far she is willing or able to go to embrace the role of forceful advocate and how much pressure she will face from the Asian American community to act as an influence on Biden to follow through on his pledges to prioritize their concerns.“Kamala’s speech in Atlanta was very well done. It was clear and to the point. She spoke from a position no other vice president could,” said Shekar Narasimhan, the Indian American chairman of the AAPI Victory Fund, a SuperPAC focused on bolstering political activism among the nation’s 23 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.Though Harris did not offer a personal reflection, “her lived experience is translating on the world stage into that authenticity,” Narasimhan added. “I’m not worried about her representing us or advocating for the right causes. The only thing I preach about her to others is: ‘Be patient.’ She has to have time to find her footing. When she finds her legs, she will be the person we want her to be, to be advocating for us and for communities of color.”Amid national attention on bias crimes, Asian American leaders struggle over where to take their movementAmong Asian American leaders, Harris is widely regarded as a source of pride and as an ally of their causes. Yet they cautioned that her ability to advocate for them could be compromised by her multiple responsibilities as Biden’s deputy. Last week, for example, the president put Harris in charge of managing an influx of unauthorized migrants, mostly from Central America.For months, starting during the campaign and continuing through the transition, Democrats in Congress and community leaders have expressed frustration that Biden has not named more Asian Americans to his senior ranks. Biden assembled the most racially diverse leadership team of any administration, with people of color making up half of his nominees and appointees.But none of his nominees for the 15 statutory Cabinet positions is an Asian American, breaking two decades of precedent from Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump.The impatience boiled over last week during a private call between Democratic lawmakers and Biden aides, during which Jen O’Malley Dillon, the White House deputy chief of staff, reportedly pointed to Harris in the discussion over Asian representation in the Cabinet.Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who is of Chinese Thai descent, later called the remarks “insulting” and announced — along with Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), a Japanese American — that they would oppose all of Biden’s nominees other than those who are racial minorities or LGBTQ. The senators withdrew their threat after the White House hastily agreed to appoint a senior official to focus on Asian American issues, a new position whose duties have yet to be defined.Duckworth told reporters that White House aides","The Vice President's South Asian heritage has put her in a unique position to give voice to the pain and anger that inspired her.

WP,Asian Hate,3,New York man charged with hate crime in Asian American attack that bystanders watched without helping,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/30/asian-american-attack-newyork-condo/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_main,"New York police arrested a suspect early Wednesday in the brutal assault of a 65-year-old Asian American woman in Manhattan that was caught on camera on Monday. The suspect is already on lifetime parole for murdering his mother, police said.Brandon Elliot, 38, was arrested at 1:10 a.m. Wednesday in Manhattan, the NYPD said in a statement shared with The Washington Post, and charged with felony assault as a hate crime. Elliot was convicted of murder in 2002, WNBC reported.The attack intensified calls for an end to anti-Asian hate crimes in the city and raised harsh criticism for three bystanders caught on video inside a luxury condo building’s lobby who witnessed the attack but did not intervene.“I don’t care who you are, I don’t care what you do, you’ve got to help your fellow New Yorker,” Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said, calling the bystanders’ actions “absolutely unacceptable.”The company that manages the condo tower announced Tuesday that the staffers involved in the incident have been suspended.“The staff who witnessed the attack have been suspended pending an investigation in conjunction with their union,” the Brodsky Organization wrote in an Instagram post, which also noted the company is trying to identify a “third-party vendor” who was also on the scene “so that appropriate action can be taken.”The case was one of two attacks on Asian Americans in New York that were caught on video and publicized Monday, on the same day that city leaders gathered in Brooklyn to urge quick action to halt a rising tide of racist violence and threats.“This is absolutely vile. These attacks against Asian-American New Yorkers must end,” New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson (D) said on Twitter, linking to a video of the attack on the woman. “Hate has no place here and we must always call it out when we see it.”In recent weeks, Asian Americans in New York have reported being punched in subway cars, spit on and pummeled with metal pipes — an ugly echo of a national trend that activists say gained traction as former president Donald Trump has used racist terms to tie the coronavirus pandemic to China.Monday’s attack happened just before noon in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood, police said, as the unidentified victim was walking along West 43rd Street. The woman was headed to church, WABC reported, when the attacker yelled, “F--- you, you don’t belong here,” and began assaulting her.The man kicked her in the stomach, knocking her to the sidewalk, and then brutally stomped on her head again and again.Video shows one man in the building’s lobby watching the entirety of the attack. That man, who appeared to be tying a stack of boxes onto a cart, stared out the glass doors as the woman was repeatedly kicked in the head, but made no move to assist her. Two other men, who were security guards according to WABC, then walked toward the entrance as the assailant left, and closed the door on the victim.The woman “sustained a serious physical injury,” the NYPD said, and was taken to NYU Langone Hospital, where she was in stable condition.After asking the public for help in identifying the assailant, the NYPD Hate Crime Task force announced Elliot’s arrest early Wednesday. He was convicted in 2002 of a vicious attack on his mother, Bridget Johnson, 42, according to a New York Daily News account at the time.

WP,Asian Hate,4,Bill to combat hate crimes against Asian Americans passes Senate with bipartisan support,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/asian-american-hate-crime-senate/2021/04/22/4c7755f0-a36a-11eb-85fc-06664ff4489d_story.html,"A previous version of this article misspelled Sen. Mazie Hirono’s name. The article has been corrected. The Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation Thursday designed to more forcefully investigate hate crimes, particularly those against Asian Americans after the March 16 shootings at three Atlanta spas and a wave of violence following the spread of the coronavirus from China last year.“To our Asian American friends: We will not tolerate bigotry against you. And to those perpetrating anti-Asian bigotry: We will pursue you to the fullest extent of the law. We cannot — we cannot — allow the recent tide of bigotry, intolerance and prejudice against Asian Americans go unchecked,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a floor speech just before the vote.The vote was 94 to 1. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) was the lone no vote.Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) introduced the bill last month, officially titled the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, based on a year’s worth of rising attacks after the pandemic began in Wuhan, China. Five days after Hirono introduced the legislation, eight people were killed, including six Asian women, in mass shootings at three Atlanta spas. The crimes heightened the pressure on Congress to respond to the rise in attacks against the Asian American community.Eight killed, including six Asian women, in Atlanta-area spa shootings; suspect arrested after manhunt“I cannot tell you how important this bill is to the AAPI community, who often has felt very visible in our country, always seen as the other. And for them to experience that kind of hatred against them,” Hirono told reporters after the legislation passed.With Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) as the lead House sponsor, the legislation would assign an official in the Justice Department to review and expedite all reports of hate crimes related to the coronavirus, expand support for local and state law enforcement agencies responding to these hate crimes, and issue guidance on mitigating the use of racially discriminatory language to describe the pandemic.Meng, in a statement after Thursday’s vote, said the House is expected to take up the legislation next month. President Biden has vowed to sign it when it reaches his desk.Republicans at first hesitated to adopt a position on the legislation, which carefully avoids any mention of former president Donald Trump’s comments about the “Kung Flu” and “the China virus” as possible inspiration for attacks on Asian Americans — but the inference is easily understood.In a rare bipartisan compromise, negotiators agreed to add a broader bill, the No Hate Act sponsored by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), to provide federal funding to conduct broader studies about the number of hate crimes every year.That decision cleared the way for last week’s initial vote to begin debate on the legislation, with 92 senators in support. Hirono and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) then spent several days negotiating the final details of the bill, which ended up more expansive than its original design and drew more support.“Senator Collins, I really appreciate your work on this bill. We would not be here without your support,” Hirono said during her speech.“Crimes motivated by bias against race, national origin, or other characteristics simply cannot be tolerated. Our amendment both denounces these acts and marshals additional resources toward addressing and stopping these despicable crimes,” Collins said in her floor speech.Their deal also assured that the Senate would reject three amendments offered by conservatives that would have been considered poison pills and brought down the entire legislation.Supporters of the legislation cited one study in 16 major cities, where hate crimes decreased overall in the past year but those crimes against Asian Americans soared 145 percent.At a news conference with Hirono and Schumer afterward, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) recalled regularly hearing the same phrase  — “Where are you from, really?” — even while serving in the Army.This legislation is needed, Duckworth said. “There’s a lot more work to be done. This is a good first step.”","The Senate overwhelmingly passes a bill designed to more forcefully investigate hate crimes.

As of late Sunday, he remained in a medically induced coma, his wife, Baozhen Chen, told the New York Daily News. Now the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force is investigating the case and searching for the suspect seen in the video, police told The Washington Post. Police told PIX 11 it is unclear whether the man yelled any anti-Asian slurs during the beating.“I am very worried that my husband is not going to make it,” Chen, 57, told the Daily News. “I want the police to capture the person as soon as possible.”The incident is the latest violent attack amid a nationwide surge of harassment and physical assaults against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. In recent months, Asian Americans in New York have been punched on subway cars, spit on, stomped in the head and subjected to anti-Asian racial slurs at work.Ma’s attack prompted dozens of New Yorkers to march on Sunday to the site of the incident to condemn anti-Asian violence and drew the attention of local officials who vowed to capture the suspect.“Make no mistake, we will find the perpetrator and they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” tweeted Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), who called the incident “outrageous.”She yelled an anti-Asian slur at a man on the street, police said. He was an undercover NYPD officer.Ma and his wife, who have two adult children, moved to New York from China’s Guangdong province in 2019 looking for better work opportunities, Chen told the Daily News. Ma, who was a dessert chef in China, found a job in a Chinatown restaurant.But like millions of other kitchen workers, Ma lost his job in the pandemic, his wife said. So last September, Ma began pushing a shopping cart across the city and stuffing it with recyclables for an extra income.That’s what Ma was doing near his East Harlem apartment last Friday around 8:20 p.m. when a man ambushed him from behind, hit him and stomped his head at least half a dozen times, surveillance video shows. A bus driver who saw Ma unconscious on the ground called the police, WABC reported. Chen, meanwhile, grew concerned when Ma did not call as usual that night to check that she had made it back safely from her job as a home attendant, she told the Daily News. When Chen dialed his number, she said, police picked up.“The police told me what happened — my husband was hit and sent to the hospital,” she said.Ma, who sustained significant injuries, was taken to NYC Health & Hospitals in Harlem in critical condition, police said. By Sunday, Ma was still breathing through a ventilator, Chen told the Daily News.On Sunday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) denounced the attack and ordered the state’s hate crimes task force to assist in the investigation.“I’m sickened to learn of yet another bigoted act of violence,” Cuomo said in statement. “This is not who we are as New Yorkers, and we will not let these cowardly acts of hate against members of our New York family intimidate us.”Chen said she fears for her life as an Asian woman living in New York and worries her husband may never recover from the brutal assault.“I’m very scared right now,” Chen told WCBS. “I’m so worried that my husband might never come back. … This should not happen to my husband or anyone else.

NYT,tesla,1,Tesla’s Autopilot Technology Faces Fresh Scrutiny,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/business/teslas-autopilot-safety-investigations.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes,"Federal regulators are investigating 23 recent accidents in which drivers were, or may have been, using the automatic steering and braking system.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Neal E. BoudetteTesla faced numerous questions about its Autopilot technology after a Florida driver was killed in 2016 when the system of sensors and cameras failed to see and brake for a tractor-trailer crossing a road.Now the company is facing more scrutiny than it has in the last five years for Autopilot, which Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have long maintained makes its cars safer than other vehicles. Federal officials are looking into a series of recent accidents involving Teslas that either were using Autopilot or might have been using it.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration confirmed last week that it was investigating 23 such crashes. In one accident this month, a Tesla Model Y rear-ended a police car that had stopped on a highway near Lansing, Mich. The driver, who was not seriously injured, had been using Autopilot, the police said.In February in Detroit, under circumstances similar to the 2016 Florida accident, a Tesla drove beneath a tractor-trailer that was crossing the road, tearing the roof off the car. The driver and a passenger were seriously injured. Officials have not said whether the driver had turned on Autopilot.NHTSA is also looking into a Feb. 27 crash near Houston in which a Tesla ran into a stopped police vehicle on a highway. It is not clear if the driver was using Autopilot. The car did not appear to slow before the impact, the police said.Autopilot is a computerized system that uses radar and cameras to detect lane markings, other vehicles and objects in the road. It can steer, brake and accelerate automatically with little input from the driver. Tesla has said it should be used only on divided highways, but videos on social media show drivers using Autopilot on various kinds of roads.“We need to see the results of the investigations first, but these incidents are the latest examples that show these advanced cruise-control features Tesla has are not very good at detecting and then stopping for a vehicle that is stopped in a highway circumstance,” said Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a group created in the 1970s by Consumers Union and Ralph Nader.This renewed scrutiny arrives at a critical time for Tesla. After reaching a record high this year, its share price has fallen about 20 percent amid signs that the company’s electric cars are losing market share to traditional automakers. Ford Motor’s Mustang Mach E and the Volkswagen ID.4 recently arrived in showrooms and are considered serious challengers to the Model Y.The outcome of the current investigations is important not only for Tesla but for other technology and auto companies that are working on autonomous cars. While Mr. Musk has frequently suggested the widespread use of these vehicles is near, Ford, General Motors and Waymo, a division of Google’s parent, Alphabet, have said that moment could be years or even decades away.Bryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina who has advised the federal government on automated driving, said it was important to develop advanced technologies to reduce traffic fatalities, which now number about 40,000 a year. But he said he had concerns about Autopilot, and how the name and Tesla’s marketing imply drivers can safely turn their attention away from the road.“There is an incredible disconnect between what the company and its founder are saying and letting people believe, and what their system is actually capable of,” he said.Tesla, which disbanded its public relations department and generally does not respond to inquiries from reporters, did not return phone calls or emails seeking comment. And Mr. Musk did not respond to questions sent to him on Twitter.The company has not publicly addressed the recent crashes. While it can determine if Autopilot was on at the time of accidents because its cars constantly send data to the company, it has not said if the system was in use.The company has argued that its cars are very safe, claiming that its own data shows that Teslas are in fewer accidents per mile driven and even fewer when Autopilot is in use. It has also said it tells drivers that they must pay close attention to the road when using Autopilot and should always be ready to retake control of their cars.A federal investigation of the 2016 fatal crash in Florida found that Autopilot had failed to recognize a white semi trailer against a bright sky, and that the driver was able to use it when he wasn’t on a highway. Autopilot continued operating the car at 74 miles per hour even as the driver, Joshua Brown, ignored several warnings to keep his hands on the steering wheel.A second fatal incident took place in Florida in 2019 under similar circumstan","Federal regulators are investigating 23 recent accidents in which drivers were, or may have been, using the automatic steering and braking system.

Anyone can read what you share.By Johnny DiazA California man seen traveling in the back seat of a driverless Tesla was arrested in the Bay Area, the authorities said on Tuesday, following a call on social media to report similar behavior to the police.The man, Param Sharma, 25, was arrested on misdemeanor charges of reckless driving and disobeying a peace officer, the California Highway Patrol said in a statement on Tuesday.The Highway Patrol said that police officers responded at about 6:35 p.m. on Monday after 911 dispatchers received calls about a Tesla Model 3 with no one in the driver’s seat traveling east on Interstate 80 across the Bay Bridge.A highway patrol officer at the bridge’s toll plaza spotted the Tesla “with its sole occupant in the back seat,” according to the Highway Patrol.While trying to pull the car over, the officer saw the passenger move into the driver’s seat. The occupant then stopped the Tesla on the shoulder of Interstate 80 and Mr. Sharma was arrested, the police said.Mr. Sharma was booked into Santa Rita Jail in Alameda County, and the Tesla was towed from the scene as evidence. Mr. Sharma did not respond to a request for comment on his case on Wednesday. It is illegal in California for an autonomous vehicle to operate without a person behind the wheel, said Officer John Fransen, a spokesman for the highway patrol.“We want people to recognize the fact the driving is an immense responsibility,” he said. “It’s not having distractions. It’s not playing around with the technology.”After his release from jail, Mr. Sharma insisted to the news station KTVU that his use of the car was not dangerous, and said that he would not change his behavior.“I’m about to go in the back seat right now. You feel me? Like, I’m waiting for my car to charge,” Mr. Sharma told the station.A man who appears to be Mr. Sharma on Instagram posted a video of himself sitting in the back seat of a moving Tesla with his foot on the steering wheel. In the video, posted Tuesday, a device is visible showing the headline: “Man seen riding in the back seat of Tesla with no driver.”Mr. Sharma also praised the chief executive of Tesla, Elon Musk, telling KTVU that he “really knows what he’s doing and I think people are just tripping and they’re scared.”Before the arrest, Bay Area residents had also captured video of someone who resembled Mr. Sharma using a driverless car in “the same reckless manner,” the Highway Patrol said. Mr. Sharma had been cited on April 27 for similar behavior by the agency’s Oakland area division.On Saturday, the Highway Patrol posted on social media that it “has been made aware of an incident involving a man riding in the back seat of a Tesla traveling on Bay Area roadways, with no other person being seated in the driver’s seat.”The post featured two photos of the driverless car with a smiling man visible in the back.The Highway Patrol asked people to immediately call 911 if they saw “an unusual incident such as this one.”The department was looking into whether the man in those images was Mr. Sharma, said Officer Fransen.Tesla and Mr. Musk have argued that the company’s Autopilot system makes its cars safer than other vehicles, even as the technology and the ways drivers use it come under greater scrutiny. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.In April, two men were killed north of Houston after a Tesla they were in crashed and caught fire with neither of them behind the wheel, the authorities said.Mark Herman, a constable in Harris County Precinct 4, said last month that physical evidence from the scene and interviews with witnesses led officials to believe “no one was driving the vehicle at the time of the crash.” In April, Consumer Reports said that its engineers had “easily tricked” a Tesla Model Y “so that it could drive on Autopilot, the automaker’s driver assistance feature, without anyone in the driver’s seat.” The publication said that during trips on its half-mile closed test track, the vehicle “steered along painted lane lines, but the system did not send out a warning or indicate in any way that the driver’s seat was empty.”In March, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that it was investigating nearly two dozen crashes involving Teslas that either were, or may have been, using the automatic steering and braking technology.","Param Sharma, 25, was arrested on charges of reckless driving and disobeying a peace officer.

NYT,tesla,3,"Elon Musk moves crypto markets with a tweet, again.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/06/14/business/economy-stock-market-news/elon-musk-moves-crypto-markets-with-a-tweet-again,"The message from many companies to their office workers is clear. It will soon be time to shed the slippers for hard shoes and return to your desk. But many companies are still puzzling over a single quandary: What to do about vaccines. Should they require employees to get them? Encourage or cajole or bribe them?“We’re all kind of, you know, flying by the seat of our pants,” said Wayne Wager, the chief executive of Remote Medical International, a consulting firm in Seattle that is helping companies that are reopening offices.Most companies are hoping to avoid requiring vaccines, reports Lauren Hirsch of The New York Times. The federal agency that enforces workplace discrimination laws says they can, but chief executives fear vaccine mandates would lead to lawsuits, invite political upheaval and be hard to enforce. But they’re worried about safety. An outbreak could force a company to retrench on masking and social distancing policies, making it even harder to get back to normal. So they are trying everything short of a mandate, without yet ruling one out.One blue-chip company that welcomed back many workers on Monday, Goldman Sachs, prepared for their return by sending an email last week telling employees to report their vaccination status within two days. In May, the bank had notified employees that they should “make plans to be in a position to return to the office” by June 14 in the United States and June 21 in Britain.Nearly a third of companies have yet to develop any vaccine policy, according to a survey of 770 companies conducted by the human resources software company Tinypulse.Some companies are effectively paying employees to share their status:Walmart is offering $75 to any worker who shows proof of vaccination.In a deal that United Airlines struck with the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents more than 59,000 pilots, airlines are paying fully vaccinated pilots a bonus equivalent to as much as 13 hours of pay.By Jeanna Smialek Consumers expect higher inflation in the near term and over the course of several years, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey found, a small but potentially important signal at a time when economic policymakers are betting that expectations will remain in check as demand and prices rebound from depressed pandemic levels.Expectations for inflation a year from now jumped by 0.6 percentage points in May, hitting a new series high of 4 percent, the Fed branch said on Monday. The Survey of Consumer Expectations has been running since 2013, so it tracks a period during which price gains have been relatively tame.Consumers also expected faster price increases in three years, anticipating gains of 3.6 percent, up from 3.1 percent in the April survey.Fed officials have worried for years that inflation expectations might be drifting too low, so they could see the survey’s findings as a positive development. The 3-year-ahead number is back at levels seen in 2013, before years of tepid price gains weighed down the outlook.At the same time, the rebound has happened abruptly, and if it continues it could push expectations too high for comfort. When consumers expect higher prices, businesses may have an easier time charging more, creating a self-fulfilling situation that sends inflation higher.Investors will have a timely opportunity to see how the Fed is interpreting the latest data, given that the central bank meets this week and is scheduled to release its latest monetary policy statement on Wednesday alongside fresh economic projections. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, will hold a news conference following that announcement.The move higher in inflation expectations comes at a time when people are showing increased confidence in the job market: Those surveyed put the probability that they will lose their job in the next year at the lowest on record in the series, and the probability of finding a job rose sharply.The labor market is gradually healing from pandemic-inflicted damage and job openings are plentiful. As the economy reopens and demand surges, supply is racing to catch up — sending inflation higher. The Fed and the White House are trying to sift through temporary, pandemic-spurred jerks in the data to gauge how much help the economy needs as it heals from more than a year of social distancing and rolling business lockdowns.By Eshe Nelson After 15 months of pandemic restrictions on businesses and socializing, England is bracing for the news that it must endure another month of restrictions beyond June 21, the date that had been set for the final lifting of Covid rules. But many analysts say a delay, put in place to get more people vaccinated as the delta variant of the virus continues to force hospitalizations to rise, would only have a minor economic impact.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce a four-week delay on Monday evening to the third phase of reopening, which would have allowed businesses to operate without capacity restrictions, nightclu","Many companies are trying everything short of a mandate, without yet ruling one out.

NYT,tesla,4,Crashes involving Tesla Autopilot and other driver-assistance systems get new scrutiny.,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/business/tesla-autopilot-safety.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur,"A federal safety agency told automakers on Tuesday to begin reporting and tracking crashes involving cars and trucks that use advanced driver-assistance technology such as Tesla’s Autopilot and General Motors’ Super Cruise, a sign that regulators are taking the safety implications of such systems more seriously.Automakers must report serious crashes within one day of learning about them, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said. Serious accidents include those in which a person is killed or taken to a hospital, a vehicle has to be towed away, or airbags are deployed.“By mandating crash reporting, the agency will have access to critical data that will help quickly identify safety issues that could emerge in these automated systems,” said Steven Cliff, the agency’s acting administrator. “Gathering data will help instill public confidence that the federal government is closely overseeing the safety of automated vehicles.”The order comes amid growing concern about the safety of such systems, in particular Autopilot, which uses radar and cameras to detect lane markings, other vehicles and objects in the road. It can steer, brake and accelerate automatically with little input from the driver, but it can sometimes become confused.At least three Tesla drivers have died since 2016 while driving with Autopilot engaged. In two cases, the system and the drivers failed to stop for tractor-trailers crossing roadways, and in a third the system and the driver failed to avoid a concrete barrier on a highway. Tesla has acknowledged that Autopilot can have trouble recognizing stopped emergency vehicles, although the company and its chief executive, Elon Musk, maintain that the system makes its cars safer than those of other manufacturers.The agency, which some auto safety experts have criticized for going easy on automakers, has begun investigations into about three dozen crashes of vehicles with advanced driver-assistance systems. All but six of those accidents, the first of which took place in June 2016, involved Teslas. Ten people were killed in eight of the Tesla crashes, and one pedestrian was killed by a Volvo that Uber was using as a test vehicle.The new reporting rule is a “welcome first step,” the Center for Auto Safety said in a statement. The center, a nonprofit in Washington, has been calling on the agency to look more closely at driver-assistance systems and to require automakers to provide more data on crashes.Critics of Autopilot say Mr. Musk has overstated the technology’s abilities, and the Autopilot name has caused some drivers to believe that they can turn their attention away from the road while the system is turned on. A few people have recorded videos of themselves leaving the driver’s seat while the car was in motion. Mr. Musk also frequently promotes a more advanced technology in development called Full Self-Driving, which Tesla has allowed some customers to use even though the company has acknowledged to regulators that the system cannot drive on its own in all circumstances.Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.Under the agency’s order on Tuesday, automakers must provide more complete information on serious crashes involving advanced driver-assistance systems within 10 days.

Mr. Maldonado flicked his turn signal and moved right. Within seconds, his Ford Explorer pickup was hit by a Tesla Model 3 that was traveling about 60 miles per hour on Autopilot.A six-second video captured by the Tesla and data it recorded show that neither Autopilot — Tesla’s much-vaunted system that can steer, brake and accelerate a car on its own — nor the driver slowed the vehicle until a fraction of a second before the crash. Fifteen-year-old Jovani, who had been in the front passenger seat and not wearing his seatbelt, was thrown from the Ford and died, according to a police report.Video footage and data retrieved from the car involved in the crash show that neither the Tesla driver nor the Autopilot system slowed the vehicle until just before impact.0.4 seconds before crashAccelerator pedal pressure before crashCar speed before crash80 m.p.h.+2%6065 m.p.h.40+1200%00–5 seconds–4–3–2–10–5 seconds–4–3–2–100.4 seconds before crashAccelerator pedal pressure before crash+2%+10%0–5 seconds–4–3–2–10Car speed before crash80 m.p.h.6065 m.p.h.40200-5seconds-4-3-2-100.4 seconds before crashAccelerator pedal pressure before crash+2%+10%0–5 seconds–4–3–2–10Car speed before crash80 m.p.h.6065 m.p.h.40200-5seconds-4-3-2-100.4 seconds before crashAccelerator pedal pressure before crash+2%+10%0–5 seconds–4–3–2–10Car speed before crash80 m.p.h.6065 m.p.h.40200-5seconds-4-3-2-10Note: Accelerator pedal pressure measures how much the pedal is being pushed down in percentage terms.Video and data from Tesla provided by Benjamin Swanson, a lawyer for the Maldonado family.By The New York TimesThe accident, which took place four miles from Tesla’s main car factory, is now the subject of a lawsuit against the company. It is one of a growing number of crashes involving Autopilot that have fueled concerns about the technology’s shortcomings, and could call into question the development of similar systems used by rival carmakers. And as cars take on more tasks previously done by humans, the development of these systems could have major ramifications — not just for the drivers of those cars but for other motorists, pedestrians and cyclists.Tesla, founded in 2003, and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have been bold in challenging the auto industry, attracting devoted fans and customers and creating a new standard for electric vehicles that other established carmakers are reckoning with. The company is worth more than several large automakers combined.But the accidents involving Autopilot could threaten Tesla’s standing and force regulators to take action against the company. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has about two dozen active investigations into crashes involving Autopilot.At least three Tesla drivers have died since 2016 in crashes in which Autopilot was engaged and failed to detect obstacles in the road. In two instances, the system did not brake for tractor-trailers crossing highways. In the third, it failed to recognize a concrete barrier. In June, the federal traffic safety agency released a list showing that at least 10 people have been killed in eight accidents involving Autopilot since 2016. That list does not include the crash that killed Jovani Maldonado.Tesla’s credibility has taken a hit, and some experts on autonomous driving say that it is hard not to question other claims made by Mr. Musk and the company. He has, for example, said several times that Tesla was close to perfecting Full Self Driving, a technology that would allow cars to drive autonomously in most circumstances — something other auto and technology companies have said is years away.Mr. Musk and Tesla did not respond to several requests for comment.Autopilot is not an autonomous driving system. Rather, it is a suite of software, cameras and sensors intended to assist drivers and prevent accidents by taking over many aspects of driving a car — even the changing of lanes. Tesla executives have claimed that handing off these functions to computers will make driving safer because human drivers are prone to mistakes and distractions, and cause most of the roughly 40,000 traffic fatalities that occur each year in the United States.“Computers don’t check their Instagram” while driving, Tesla’s director of artificial intelligence, Andrej Karpathy, said last month in an online workshop on autonomous driving.While Autopilot is in control, drivers can relax, but are not supposed to tune out.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has the authority to force a recall or require new safety features.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Neal E. Boudette and Niraj ChokshiThe U.S. auto safety regulator said Monday that it had opened a broad investigation of the Autopilot system used in hundreds of thousands of Tesla’s electric cars.The investigation was prompted by at least 11 accidents in which Teslas using Autopilot, an assisted-driving system that can steer, accelerate and brake on its own, drove into parked fire trucks, police cars and other emergency vehicles, the safety agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, disclosed. Those crashes killed one woman and injured 17 people.Safety experts and regulators have been scrutinizing Autopilot since the first fatal accident involving the system was reported in 2016, in which the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed when his car struck a tractor-trailer in Florida. In that case, the safety agency concluded there were no defects — a position it stuck to for years even as the number of crashes and deaths involving Autopilot climbed.On Monday, the agency appeared to change course. The investigation is the broadest look yet at Autopilot and at potential flaws that could make it and the Teslas that operate on it dangerous.Depending on its findings, the safety agency could force Tesla to recall cars and make changes to the system. It also has the authority to force automakers to add safety devices and features to their cars, such as when it required rearview cameras and airbags.One critical issue that investigators will focus on is how Autopilot ensures that Tesla drivers are paying attention to the road and are prepared to retake control of their cars in case the system fails to recognize and brake for something. The company’s owner’s manuals instruct drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel, but the system continues operating even if drivers only occasionally tap the wheel.“Driver monitoring has been a big deficiency in Autopilot,” said Raj Rajkumar, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who focuses on autonomous vehicles. “I think this investigation should have been initiated some time ago, but it’s better late than never.”Tesla, the world’s most valuable automaker by far, and its charismatic and brash chief executive, Elon Musk, have said Autopilot is not flawed, insisting that it makes cars much safer than others on the road. They have dismissed warnings from safety experts and the National Transportation Safety Board that have been critical of how the company has designed Autopilot.The company and Mr. Musk, who comments frequently on Twitter, did not respond to messages seeking comment on Monday and issued no public statements about the new investigation.Mr. Musk has previously been dismissive of the idea that Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance system ought to monitor drivers, and he said in 2019 that human intervention could make such systems less safe.His views stand in stark contrast to the approach General Motors and other automakers have taken. G.M., for example, offers a driver-assistance system known as Super Cruise on a few models. The system allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel but uses an infrared camera to monitor drivers’ eyes to ensure that they are looking at the road.The safety agency said it would also examine how Autopilot identifies objects on the road and under what conditions Autopilot can be turned on. Tesla tells drivers to use the system only on divided highways, but it can be used on smaller roads and streets. G.M. uses GPS to restrict Super Cruise’s use to major highways that do not have oncoming or cross traffic, intersections, pedestrians and cyclists.Tesla’s Autopilot system appears to have difficulty detecting and braking for parked cars generally, including private cars and trucks without flashing lights. In July, for example, a Tesla crashed into a parked sport utility vehicle. The driver had Autopilot on, had fallen asleep and later failed a sobriety test, the California Highway Patrol said.The safety agency’s investigation will look at all models of Teslas — Y, X, S and 3 — from the 2014 to 2021 model years, totaling 765,000 cars, a large majority of the vehicles the company has made in the United States.The new investigation comes on top of reviews the safety agency is conducting of more than two dozen crashes involving Autopilot. The agency has said eight of those crashes resulted in a total of 10 deaths. Those investigations are meant to delve into the details of individual cases to provide data and insights that the agency and automakers can use to improve safety or identify problem areas.Tesla has acknowledged that Autopilot can sometimes fail to recognize stopped emergency vehicles. And ","The investigation was prompted by at least 11 accidents in which Teslas using Autopilot, an assisted-driving system that can steer, accelerate and",There are literally thousands of car accidents a day with people who actually “pilot” the vehicle. 11 accidents on auto pilot is pretty darn good.,"So why arn't they investigating the thousands of crashes by Ford, Chevy, Honda etc etc.",Negative Anticipation,Negative ,US investigates Tesla crashes
NYT,tesla,7,Tesla is ordered to turn over Autopilot data to a federal safety agency.,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/business/tesla-autopilot-investigation.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur,"The main federal auto safety agency has ordered Tesla to hand over a trove of data on its Autopilot driver-assistance system as part of an investigation into Tesla cars crashing into fire trucks or other emergency vehicles parked on roads and highways.In a letter dated Tuesday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told the electric carmaker to produce detailed information on how Autopilot works, how it ensures drivers are paying attention to the road and whether there are any limits on where it can be turned on.The safety agency is also seeking detailed data on how many cars Tesla has sold in the United States, any arbitration proceedings or lawsuits related to Autopilot crashes that the company has been involved in, and the complaints Tesla has received about Autopilot from customers.The agency asked Tesla to deliver the information by Oct. 22, noting that it could impose fines of up to $115 million if the company fails or refuses to comply. The letter is signed by Gregory Magno, chief of the vehicle defects division in the agency’s Office of Defects Investigation.The safety agency informed Tesla weeks ago that it was looking into the spate of crashes in which Tesla vehicles operating on Autopilot failed to detect stopped emergency vehicles with flashing lights. The regulator originally said it was looking into 11 such crashes. A 12th occurred on Saturday, when a Model 3 hit a police cruiser that had stopped behind a car that had broken down on an interstate in Orlando, Fla.The driver told the police that the Model 3 had been in Autopilot mode, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The Tesla narrowly missed hitting a state trooper.The request for data suggests that the safety agency’s investigation is moving quickly. Safety experts have criticized the agency for doing little to investigate a growing number of crashes, injuries and fatalities involving Tesla vehicles operating with Autopilot turned on over the last five years. The safety agency said this summer that it was looking into about 30 Autopilot-related crashes, including eight that resulted in 10 deaths.Safety experts and another federal agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, have pointed out that Autopilot lacks effective safeguards to ensure drivers keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel while using the system. It is supposed to be used only on divided highways but lacks mechanisms for prohibiting use on local roads — features that General Motors, Ford Motor and other automakers have built into similar systems.",The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has ordered Tesla to hand over data on its Autopilot driver-assistance system.

WP,tesla,2,Tesla crash that killed two shines spotlight on company’s shaky history with U.S. safety investigators,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/20/tesla-crash-investigation/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_main,"Officials said Tesla is not party to a probe into a weekend Model S crash that killed two — a departure from typical protocol and a potential sign of the auto company’s strained relations with investigators.National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway said Tuesday was investigators’ first full day at the scene of the crash in a Houston suburb,  and they were probing the vehicle’s operation and the subsequent fire. He added Tesla was “working with” investigators “but is not a party to the investigation.”The NTSB booted Tesla as a party to its probe into another fatal crash in 2018 after the car manufacturer disclosed investigative information before the investigation’s conclusion.Holloway referred questions on Tesla’s involvement to the company, which has disbanded its public relations department. The company did not respond to a request for comment.On Monday, Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla data “so far” indicated the car’s Autopilot driver assistance system wasn’t in use during the crash. Autopilot is a Tesla driver assistance system that can navigate from highway on-ramp to off-ramp, can detect stop lights and stop signs, and can self-park and summon the vehicle. Police previously said there wasn’t anyone in the driver’s seat during the crash.According to Reuters, the Harris County Constable said it planned to serve search warrants to Tesla to secure data from the car that crashed following Musk’s tweet. The Harris County Constable Precinct 4 did not return repeated messages requesting comment.Musk also tweeted Tuesday about the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has taken a more hands off approach to safety regulation of the electric carmaker.“NHTSA is great,” he wrote.Investigators are probing how two men were killed Saturday when a Model S sedan veered off the road, leading to a fire that took hours to extinguish, according to police.The NTSB said Monday it was sending a team of investigators to investigate the crash and subsequent fire, which smoldered for hours and required more than 30,000 gallons to put out.A driverless Tesla crashed and burned for four hours, police said, killing two passengers in Texas“Our investigation has determined that one of the victims was in the front passenger seat; one was in the back seat,” Mark Herman, a constable for Harris County Precinct 4, told the station KHOU, adding that police were “100 percent certain” that the driver’s seat was unoccupied.Tesla has said that drivers should pay full attention while using Autopilot.In past investigations, officials have required Tesla’s assistance to decode data from Tesla’s proprietary onboard systems. That generally makes the automaker’s cooperation critical to federal safety investigations.NTSB ‘unhappy’ with Tesla release of investigative information in fatal crashTesla was removed from an investigation into the death of 38-year-old Apple engineer Walter Huang, who was killed when his Model X SUV slammed into a highway barrier in California in 2018. The NTSB ultimately cited Autopilot system limitations, the driver’s distraction from a cellphone game, and apparent overreliance on the Autopilot system, in the crash.Elon Musk moved to Texas and embraced celebrity. Can Tesla run on Autopilot?Before the investigation’s conclusion, Tesla issued a preliminary explanation in a blog post, where it said that Autopilot was activated moments before the crash and the car’s cruise control distance was set to a minimum, meaning it would tail somewhat closely behind other cars.“At this time the NTSB needs the assistance of Tesla to decode the data the vehicle recorded. In each of our investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data. However, the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla,” NTSB spokesman Chris O’Neil said at the time.The NTSB ultimately issued its findings in 2020, and went on to criticize federal regulators for a “lack of leadership” on technologies promising what it regarded as partial automation to drivers. The NTSB has also called directly for NHTSA to impose stricter standards on automation, most recently when chairman Robert Sumwalt issued a letter to the agency urging stricter standards earlier this year.NHTSA did not respond to a request for comment on the Tesla probe on Tuesday. The agency said Monday it was aware of the “tragic crash” and launched a special investigation team to look into the matter. It was one of 28 investigations into Tesla vehicle crashes the agency has initiated, it said, including four completed cases.In an NTSB investigation, party status is limited to “those persons, Federal, state, or local government agencies and organizations whose employees, functions, activities, or products were involved in the accident and that can provide suitable qualified technical personnel to actively assist in an investigation,” according to federal regulations published online by Corn",The National Transportation Safety Board says it is not party to a probe into a crash that killed two.

It is now among the four most valuable cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, worth more than such corporate giants as Ford, Kraft Heinz and Marriott, at about $65 billion.Musk’s appearance did provide the ratings boost that SNL executive producer Lorne Michaels and NBC appeared to be hoping for. The show notched the third-highest ratings of the 20 planned episodes this season. Its 4.8 household rating — that is, nearly 5 percent of homes with a TV watched it — marked a 33 percent increase over the most recent new episode in April, hosted by the actress Carey Mulligan.It was outpaced by the Nov. 7 episode hosted by the comic Dave Chappelle, which scored a 5.7 household rating, and one hosted by Chris Rock. It tied with the show hosted by singer Adele.The numbers, measured overnight by Nielsen, could still shift slightly.Meanwhile, digital traffic — a key metric for SNL popularity — has been strong for the episode. As of Monday, Musk’s monologue had racked up nearly 6 million views, while his appearance as Wario — a meme-ready sketch Musk has already tabbed as his favorite — surpassed 3 million. Both figures are higher than many comparable clips in other episodes this season.Throughout the year, Musk has been vocal in his praise of dogecoin, with his pronouncements often coinciding with price surges. Last month, Musk tweeted: “The Dogefather SNL May 8.”On Sunday evening, Musk continued his doge-evangelism, tweeting details about SpaceX’s “DOGE-1 Mission to the Moon” scheduled for early next year. SpaceX, on a Falcon 9 rocket, plans to deliver a 40-kilogram satellite from Geometric Energy Corp., which will finance the mission using dogecoin.“To the mooooonnn!!” Musk tweeted, alongside a YouTube link of a meme-inspired dogecoin song.By Monday morning dogecoin was trading at just under 50 cents.Dogecoin’s astounding rise is part of a broader rally in the world of cryptocurrency. Several popular tokens have doubled or tripled in value within months.Bitcoin, the most well-known and valuable cryptocurrency, began the year at less than $30,000, but has catapulted to around $60,000, marking a roughly 100 percent climb. Ethereum, the second-most valuable cryptocurrency, surpassed $4,000 for the first time this weekend, blazing a path upward of more than 450 percent.The S&P 500, a benchmark index for the overall stock market, by contrast is up roughly 13 percent for the year.Steven Zeitchik contributed to this report.An earlier version of this story incorrectly said a recent ""Saturday Night Live"" episode hosted by Carey Mulligan aired in March.

It was the fourth U.S. death involving the Autopilot self-driving system, the newswire wrote. And it is sure to further complicate Tesla’s already-troubled relationship with transportation safety regulators.Public affairs staffers at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the California Highway Patrol did not respond to requests for further information Friday afternoon. Tesla did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.A driverless Tesla crashed and burned for four hours, police said, killing two passengers in TexasThe investigation into the May 5 crash is the 29th probe NHTSA has initiated into crashes involving Tesla vehicles, according to information previously disclosed by the agency.The investigation is likely to complicate Tesla’s attempts to gain broader market acceptance for its self-driving vehicles. There are concerns that the automated driving system is not ready for consumer use.A coalition of competing automakers criticized Tesla’s vehicles as not truly autonomous because they still require an active driver. Tesla’s vehicles rely on an elaborate array of cameras and radar sensors to remain aware of the vehicles surroundings, as opposed to the lidar sensors employed by some other electric vehicles.Tesla’s website and safety manuals do not describe Autopilot as a fully autonomous system, and they emphasize that drivers must be paying attention and ready to intervene.The car is supposed to sense whether there is a person in the driver’s seat and act accordingly. But there have been several recent instances in which people have been caught allowing the car to drive completely on its own. On Tuesday, the California Highway Patrol arrested a man who was sitting in the back seat of his Tesla as it drove down the highway, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.Tesla is like an ‘iPhone on wheels.’ And consumers are locked into its ecosystem.There have been numerous instances in which apparently distracted drivers failed to control Tesla vehicles at critical moments. In a 2018 incident, the driver of a Tesla model X SUV died in a crash near Mountain View, Calif., after accessing a video game on his phone. In another case, a Tesla’s sensing cameras failed to identify a truck’s white side against a brightly lit sky.In mid-April, a Tesla crashed into a tree in a suburb outside of Houston, and it took firefighters four hours to put out flames fueled by the car’s battery pack. When the fire was out, they concluded that neither of the car’s two occupants had been in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash. A Tesla executive later broke with that official account and claimed that a person had been in the driver’s seat. A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman later said Tesla was “working with” the investigation but is “not a party” to it, a break with typical procedure that suggests a strained relationship between Tesla and regulators.The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.",The May 5 crash near Los Angeles was the fourth U.S. death involving the Autopilot system.

Now it’s helping Detroit, and Elon Musk isn’t happy.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/15/tesla-biden-administration/?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social,"President Biden held a splashy event on the White House’s South Lawn last month to announce an ambitious goal: to make half of new passenger vehicle sales electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel-cell electric vehicles by 2030.But a key player in the industry was nowhere to be seen. Elon Musk and the country’s leading electric-car manufacturer, Tesla, had been left out of the festivities.For Tesla, it may have signaled the end of a long honeymoon period with the government, when the company was bolstered by federal tax incentives that drove growth and sales, emissions compliance credits that ushered in profitability and relatively hands-off oversight that allowed it to put new technology in the hands of customers without much fear of regulators stepping in.The latest blow came this month. House Democrats unveiled a proposal to allow an extra $4,500 in consumer incentives to buy a new electric vehicle — provided it was union-made in the United States. Tesla is the only major American automaker whose production is not unionized.The House Ways and Means Committee voted Wednesday to advance its sections of the bill, including the electric-vehicle and green energy proposals, to the House Budget Committee.Biden calls for half of new cars to be electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030The proposal prompted Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, to sound off on his preferred medium, Twitter, over the perceived slight in recent days.“This is written by Ford/UAW lobbyists, as they make their electric car in Mexico,” he wrote in response to a tweet accusing lawmakers of “targeting one company.” “Not obvious how this serves American taxpayers,” Musk said.It’s a different playing field for the company, which enjoyed closer relationships with the past two former administrations. It’s also part of a bigger twist for tech giants and Silicon Valley, which have generally faced an uptick in regulation, public criticism and overall scrutiny under the Biden administration.Tesla, in particular, is used to being touted and even coddled by a government eager to show off Silicon Valley’s ingenuity and the innovative spirit ushered in by a friendly regulatory climate. President Barack Obama toured Musk’s rocket-building company SpaceX with Musk in 2010. Musk talked with President Donald Trump, The Washington Post has reported, and even welcomed Trump’s support as he defiantly reopened Tesla’s Fremont, Calif., production facilities amid coronavirus lockdowns last year.The same month Musk was snubbed at the Biden event, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into Tesla’s driver-assistance suite, known as Autopilot, in connection with about a dozen crashes involving parked emergency vehicles. Tesla has faced scrutiny over the until-now largely unregulated technology in connection with driver deaths while the software was activated and concerns that it has led to driver inattentiveness.Tesla is putting ‘self-driving’ in the hands of drivers amid criticism the tech is not readyNow, the House Ways and Means committee has advanced the package that would extend a $7,500 tax credit to consumers for new electric vehicles — plus $4,500 for cars that are assembled using union-labor in the United States. (An additional $500 would be available if battery cells are manufactured in the country, and no less than half of the vehicle’s component parts are American-made.)Erin Hatch Thomas, communications director at the House Ways and Means Committee, said the proposal merely reflected the priorities of the committee.“The Democratic Caucus strongly values workers’ rights as well as American-based manufacturing, both of which this proposal encourages,” she said.Still, the House bill, analysts and officials said, puts pressure on other automakers that Musk targeted in his tweet. Ford, for example, assembles its electric Mach-E SUV in Mexico, and so the vehicle would not qualify for the additional $4,500 in incentives unless it brings production into one of its U.S. plants, officials said.General Motors did not immediately provide comment, and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.Tesla has previously benefited from government programs meant to stimulate demand for electric vehicles and help companies adopt green technologies. For example, consumers cashed in on $7,500 in federal tax credits for the first 200,000 vehicles Tesla sold in the country, an option that was quickly exhausted as consumers took around $10,000 worth of combined total incentives in California, which provided its own bonuses.The initial incentives were part of Great Recession-era programs aimed at stimulating demand in budding electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.Tesla also sells regulatory credits to other automakers, such as Chrysler-parent Stellantis, that allows it to burnish its quarterly profits. The credit systems are a result of a patchwork of state, federal and even international regulations meant to lower vehicle emissions.It works like this: Automake",Tesla is the only major American automaker whose production is not unionized.

WP,tesla,6,"Tesla owners can now request ‘Full Self-Driving,’ prompting criticism from regulators and safety advocates",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/24/tesla-full-self-driving/?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_source=twitter,"Tesla began letting owners request its “Full Self-Driving” software early Saturday, opening up for wide release its most advanced driver-assistance suite and signaling that thousands of drivers will soon be on the road with the unregulated and largely untested features.It’s the first time the company has let typical owners upgrade to the software it terms self-driving, although the name itself is an exaggeration by industry and regulatory standards. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk had said owners would be able to request this weekend the upgraded suite of advanced driver-assistance features, which Tesla says is a beta, although they wouldn’t receive the capabilities right away.Owners will have to agree to let Tesla monitor their driving behavior through the company insurance calculator. Tesla issued a detailed guide specifying the criteria under which drivers would be graded. If their driving is deemed to be “good” over a seven-day period, Musk said on Twitter, “beta access will be granted.”Tesla is like an ‘iPhone on wheels.’ And consumers are locked into its ecosystem.It’s the latest twist in a saga that has regulators, safety advocates and relatives of Tesla crash victims up in arms because of the potential for chaos as the technology is unleashed on real-world roads. Until now, roughly 2,000 beta testers have had access to the technology.This weekend’s release would make it available to those who have purchased the now-$10,000 software upgrade, and those who have purchased a subscription from Tesla for about $100 to $200 per month — if they can first pass Tesla’s safety monitoring.As recently as July, Musk said the technology was a “debatable” proposition, arguing that “we need to make Full Self-Driving work in order for it to be a compelling value proposition.”Elon Musk says Tesla drivers can now subscribe to ‘Full Self-Driving.’ But he isn’t sure they should.And already, investigators are looking at its predecessor, dubbed Autopilot, which navigates vehicles from highway on-ramp to off-ramp and can park and summon cars, with a driver monitoring the software. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation last month into about a dozen crashes involving parked emergency vehicles while Autopilot was engaged.“Full Self-Driving” expands Autopilot’s capabilities to city streets and offers the ability to navigate the vehicle turn-by-turn, from point A to point B.Tesla and NHTSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Tesla has repeatedly argued that Autopilot is safer than cars being driven manually when the modes are compared using Tesla data and information from NHTSA.Musk has said that “Autopilot is unequivocally safer” than typical cars. The data is not directly comparable, however, because Autopilot is supposed to be activated on certain types of roads in conditions where it can function properly.Tesla’s move to rapidly roll out the features to large numbers of users is drawing criticism from regulators and industry peers who say the company is taking a hasty approach to an issue that requires careful study and an emphasis on safety.Tesla Autopilot faces U.S. safety regulator’s scrutiny after crashes with emergency vehiclesDespite its name, the new software does not qualify as “self-driving” under criteria set by the auto industry or safety regulators, and drivers should always pay attention while it is activated.“I do think that their product is misleading and overall leads to further misuse and abuse,” said National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy, before turning to Musk himself. “I’d just ask him to prioritize safety as much as he prioritizes innovation and new technologies … safety is just as important, if not more important, than the development of the technology itself.”As for the evaluation period for drivers who want to sign up, Tesla posted its “safety score” system on its website shortly before the button’s release. It said drivers would be scored on a 0 to 100 criteria, with most receiving 80 or above. Drivers will be assessed on five factors, it said: forward collision warnings per 1,000 miles, instances of hard braking, aggressive turning, unsafe following and forced disengagements of the Autopilot system. Tesla would then use a formula to calculate their score.“These are combined to estimate the likelihood that your driving could result in a future collision,” Tesla wrote. It was not immediately clear what score would qualify as “good” — as characterized by Musk — in order to receive Full Self-Driving.Musk had earlier said drivers who make frequent use of the company’s Autopilot software will be rated favorably. Owners will be able to track their progress in real time, he said, and will be guided on how they can satisfy the requirements.Late last month, industry group Chamber of Progress took aim at Tesla’s marketing of the technology.Tesla’s cars “aren’t actually fully self-driving,” wrote the group, which is supported by Apple, ",Tesla drivers will be able to subscribe to 'Full Self-Driving' software. It's the first time the company has let drivers upgrade to,"Not sure I want to download ""Self Driving Mode"" for a car made by a Bond villain going through a breakup.",...how is this legal??,Negative Anticipation,Neutral Surprise   ,Tesla enables full self driving
WP,tesla,7,Elon Musk announces Tesla is moving its headquarters from California to Texas,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/07/musk-tesla-texas/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=wp_main,"Tesla will move its headquarters from Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, CEO Elon Musk announced at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Thursday.Musk had hinted for months that a move to Texas could be imminent. He also started residing in the state — the country’s second largest and second most populous — where Tesla has ramped up a factory in Austin and where many of the operations for his aerospace firm, SpaceX, are based. Musk lashed out last year at California’s restrictive shelter-in-place measures during the coronavirus pandemic and their effect on the company’s ability to operate its largest production facility in Fremont, Calif.Elon Musk moved to Texas and embraced celebrity. Can Tesla run on Autopilot?A move of the company’s corporate headquarters signals a major shift for Tesla, which traces its roots to Silicon Valley and has drawn from a lush environment of incentives for electric-vehicle buyers and green-energy initiatives to propel its growth. The company’s proximity to Stanford University has provided a rich landscape of engineers from which to choose — and its Silicon Valley location placed it within the radius of numerous technology companies, including Google, Apple and Facebook.“I’m excited to announce we are moving our headquarters to Austin, Texas,” Musk said. “Just to be clear, though, we will be continuing to expand our activities in California. This is not a matter of Tesla leaving California.”A message for the office of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) was not immediately returned.Erin Mellon, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), defended the state’s policies and economic climate following the news.”California is the birthplace of innovation, the 5th largest economy in the world, and home to the biggest ideas and companies on the planet – that success is not despite our progressive policies, but because of them,” Mellon said. “We stand up for our workers, public health, and a woman’s right to choose. These are California’s fundamental values, and we’ll continue creating more jobs than any other state, outpacing the nation’s economic recovery, and maintaining the lowest COVID-19 case rates in the country.”Musk said Tesla has approached the limits of its capacity in California, though it will continue to grow in the state, aiming to increase its output at the Fremont plant by 50 percent. The Austin move, he said, gives the company the chance to build out in a location where there is ample space to support its growth. Capacity at the Fremont factory, where Tesla has more than 10,000 workers, has reached its limits.The government helped Tesla conquer electric cars. Now it’s helping Detroit, and Elon Musk isn’t happy.Tesla’s corporate headquarters occupies a lot in Palo Alto’s Stanford Research Park that had been the site of other companies, such as Hewlett-Packard. The area quickly became constrained as the company grew, with workers unable to park at the office and some shifting to other locations around the Bay Area. The location, at 350,000 square feet on 23 acres, was built to house hundreds of employees.“Roughly 350 employees will work in Palo Alto initially, with space for up to 650 people at the facility,” read a Tesla news release at the time.Tesla noted in its release that the move to Palo Alto and the build-out of the facility was funded in large part by Energy Department loans. The company noted how it had received nearly $465 million in low-interest loans “to accelerate the production of affordable, fuel-efficient electric vehicles,” precipitating its move.In Fremont, meanwhile, Musk said Tesla arrived to a sprawling facility that it could hardly fill, where it was like “kids in parents’ shoes.”“Now we’re like spam in a can here,” Musk said.He added that Austin proved more accommodating for the pool of workers Tesla is aiming to attract to the company. The costs and constraints of the Bay Area began to be prohibitive, he said.“It’s tough for people to afford houses and a lot of people have to come in from far away,” he said. “There’s a limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area.”Tesla files suit in response to coronavirus restrictions after Musk threatens to relocate operationsMike Ramsey, automotive analyst with Gartner, said the decision reflected numerous business concerns — from the growth of the company to Musk’s place of residence and the escalating presence of his other company, SpaceX, in Texas. For many workers in California, however, he said, little would change.“Texas — in my view — the main thing that it has going for it is that’s where the center of gravity has moved for SpaceX,” Ramsey said. “If you’re planning to put manufacturing there, it is a lower-cost business state than California, there’s no doubt.”“It’s more than symbolic, but, you know, for a lot of people in California and people who work there, [that] probably won’t change,” he said.The move would probably have an impact on how Tesla would approach California going forward, said Ja","Tesla will move its headquarters from Palo Alto, California to Austin, Texas.

WP,tesla,8,Elon Musk took to a Twitter poll to decide whether to sell a tenth of his Tesla stock. Twitter users said yes.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/07/musk-twitter-tesla-stock/?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_source=twitter,"Elon Musk launched a Twitter poll over the weekend asking users whether he should part with 10 percent of his shares in the electric vehicle company.Twitter users said yes. In a poll that amassed more than 3.5 million votes, 58 percent supported a sale.Musk, the outspoken Tesla CEO who has gotten into regulatory trouble over some tweets, took the unusual step of crowdsourcing advice for his financial portfolio Saturday afternoon.“I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes,” Musk wrote.Such a sale would come as Tesla’s stock has ballooned past a trillion dollars in value, trading at more than $1,200 a share.

Can Tesla run on Autopilot?It was not immediately clear if or when Musk would sell the stock. After the poll closed, he replied to a user saying, “I was prepared to accept either outcome.”Tesla’s stock gains have propelled Musk to the title of world’s richest person, with an estimated net worth of $318 billion, according to Forbes. Musk launched his poll amid discussions around a billionaire tax in the U.S. Senate, which would tax unrealized gains of a handful of the richest Americans before such assets are sold.Estimates have said Musk would pay as much as $50 billion over the tax’s first five years.Musk said he does not take a cash salary or bonus, so “the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock.”Democrats’ billionaire tax would heavily target 10 wealthiest Americans, but alternative plan is emergingSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who proposed the tax in the U.S. Senate, criticized Musk’s poll Saturday on Twitter and said it only affirmed his proposal.“Whether or not the world’s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn’t depend on the results of a Twitter poll,” his tweet read. “It’s time for the Billionaires Income Tax.”Musk responded with a vulgar tweet about Wyden’s profile picture, which has since been retweeted more than 9,500 times. Musk’s tweets have landed him in trouble in the past.Elon Musk and the SEC resolve dispute over the Tesla CEO’s tweetsThe Securities and Exchange Commission fined Musk and Tesla $20 million each, and Musk was stripped of his Tesla board chairmanship, after Musk tweeted in 2018 he had “Funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share.An agreement with the regulatory body required Musk’s potentially market-moving tweets to be vetted by a securities lawyer.Musk sent Tesla’s stock into a nosedive last May when he tweeted that he thought Tesla’s stock was overvalued, writing “Tesla stock price is too high imo,” shorthand for in my opinion.","Musk, the outspoken Tesla CEO, took the unusual step of crowdourcing advice for his 10 percent stake in Tesla.

CNN,tesla,1,Tesla is under investigation because its cars keep hitting emergency vehicles,https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/16/business/tesla-autopilot-federal-safety-probe/index.html?utm_source=twCNN&utm_content=2021-08-16T18%3A50%3A12&utm_term=link&utm_medium=social,"Federal safety regulators are investigating at least 11 accidents involving Tesla cars using Autopilot or other self-driving features that crashed into emergency vehicles when coming upon the scene of an earlier crash.The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration said seven of these accidents resulted 17 injuries and one death.All of the Teslas in question had the self-driving Autopilot feature or the traffic-aware cruise control engaged as they approached the crashes, the NHTSA said.Tesla (TSLA) stock fell 5% in morning trading following news of the probe.The accidents under investigation occurred between January 22, 2018, and July 10, 2021, across nine different states. They took place mostly at night, and the post-accident scenes all included control measures like first responder vehicle lights, flares, an illuminated arrow board and road cones. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the probe.The safety of Tesla's Autopilot feature has been questioned before. The National Transportation Safety Board, a separate agency that also investigates plane crashes and other fatal accidents, found Autopilot partly to blame in a 2018 fatal crash in Florida that killed a Tesla driver. Police in a Houston suburb said there was no one in the driver's seat of a Tesla that crashed and killed two people in the car earlier this year, a charge that Tesla has denied. But Lars Moravy, Tesla's vice president of vehicle engineering, confirmed in April in comments to investors that Tesla's adaptive cruise control was engaged and accelerated to 30 mph before that car crashed.Tesla has been seeking to offer full self-driving technology to its drivers. But while it says that its data shows cars using Autopilot have fewer accidents per mile than cars being driven by drivers, it does warn ""current Autopilot features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.""The safety agency said its investigation will allow it to ""better understand the causes of certain Tesla crashes,"" including ""the technologies and methods used to monitor, assist, and enforce the driver's engagement with driving while Autopilot is in use."" It will also look into any contributing factors in the crashes.""NHTSA reminds the public that no commercially available motor vehicles today are capable of driving themselves,"" said the agency in a statement. ""Every available vehicle requires a human driver to be in control at all times, and all state laws hold human drivers responsible for operation of their vehicles. Certain advanced driving assistance features can promote safety by helping drivers avoid crashes and mitigate the severity of crashes that occur, but as with all technologies and equipment on motor vehicles, drivers must use them correctly and responsibly.""The investigation involves the Tesla Y, X, S and 3 with model years 2014 to 2021.Gordon Johnson, an analyst and vocal critic of Tesla, wrote in a note to clients Monday that the issue isn't just about Autopilot users — but also other non-Tesla drivers on the road who could be injured by cars using the feature.""NHTSA is zeroing in on a particular danger that Tesla creates for people outside the vehicle — ie, those who never agreed to be Autopilot 'guinea pigs,'"" Johnson wrote. ""Thus, to simply say 'Tesla drivers accept Autopilot's risks,' as has been used in the past, does not appear to be a defense here.""Self-driving options such as Tesla's Autopilot or more widely available adaptive cruise control, available on a wide range of automakers' vehicles, do a good job of slowing a vehicle down when the car in front is slowing down, said Sam Abuelsamid, an expert in self-driving vehicles and principal analyst at Guidehouse Insights. But Abuelsamid said those vehicles are designed to ignore stationary objects when traveling at more than 40 mph so they don't slam on the brakes when approaching overpasses or other stationary objects on the side of the road, such as a car stopped on the shoulder. Fortunately most of these vehicles with some kind of automatic braking do stop for stationary objects when they're moving more slowly, Abuelsamid said. The real problem he said is that many more Tesla owners assume their cars can, in fact, drive themselves than do drivers of other cars with automatic braking and other safety features. And the cues that a driver would see when approaching an accident site, such as road flares or flashing lights, make more sense to a human than they might to an auto drive system.""When it works, which can be most of the time, it can be very good,"" said Abuelsamid, about Tesla's Autopilot feature. ""But it can easily be confused by things that humans would have no problem with. Machine visions are not as adaptive as humans. And the problem is that all machine systems sometimes make silly errors.""",Federal safety agency investigating at least 11 accidents involving Tesla cars.

For the two most expensive cars, the Model S and Model X, buyers will have to wait until March or April 2022 for anything but the upper-end ""Plaid"" version of the Model S. For those most pricey Tesla models, the estimated delivery time is January or February.The upper-end ""performance"" version of the Model 3 can be delivered within four to six weeks, and that version of the Model X can be had in five to six weeks. But for less expensive models you'll have to wait until between November to January.The reason for the delays: A parts shortage that is temporarily shutting down auto plants around the world. ""The chip shortage issue isn't moderating to the extent that the Tesla bulls had hoped,"" said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and one of the analysts with a bullish forecast on Tesla shares. He said the delivery estimates have all been pushed back during the course of the last week.Tesla did not respond to questions about the longer delivery estimates. In late July, CEO Elon Musk warned investors about problems with the supply of computer chips and other parts, telling them, ""The chip supply is fundamentally the governing factor on our output. It is difficult for us to see how long this will last because ... this is out of our control essentially. It does seem like it's getting better, but it's hard to predict."" As for other parts, he cautioned, ""For the rest of this year, our growth rates will be determined by the slowest part in our supply chain.""Tesla shares have been struggling for much of 2021 after a 743% rise in value during 2020. Ives said he thinks that these new delivery estimates can only continue to weigh on the stock as investors worry the company will be able to hit market expectations of 900,000 vehicles delivered during the course of this year. Tesla has said it expects to have only more than a 50% increase on its 2020 deliveries of 500,000 cars.""It's one thing to talk about futuristic projects,"" Ives said. ""But the investors are focused on deliveries and rising competition in the EV space. That's the overhang on the stock right now.""These delivery estimates are for US sales, not sales in Europe or Asia, which are being sourced out of its plant in Shanghai.Earlier this year Tesla halted production of the Model S and Model X altogether in the first quarter, as it tried to keep production going on the better selling, less expensive models. It may be doing so again. But these delivery estimates show that Tesla is probably building only the more profitable versions of those less expensive models in the near term.Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the longer delivery times.The problems with parts slowing production is by no means unique to Telsa. Toyota (TM), the world's largest automaker by number of vehicles sold, announced Thursday that it was cutting production as much as 60% in the North America and about 40% at plants in Japan in September. Volkswagen (VLKAF) is also weighing production cuts, and General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and Stellantis have all announced temporary plant shutdowns due to part shortages caused by rising covid cases globally, especially in Southeast Asia, where many suppliers have been forced to cut or halt production.",Estimated delivery times for all but the upper-end models of the Model 3 sedan and Model Y are pushed back.

But they'll first have to show that they're a sufficiently safe driver by allowing Tesla to analyze data on their driving behavior. Approved drivers may then get access to ""full self-driving"" beta software as soon as Oct. 9, according to a tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. A small group of private citizens, no more than a few thousand at most, have already been testing the system for nearly a year, and the videos they've posted on social media of Teslas attempting to drive themselves through traffic have received both cautious praise and derision. Tesla has not released information on exactly how many drivers, who they were, or how they were selected to be in the first ""full self-driving"" public beta test. Tesla has been criticized for not getting consent from the pedestrians, cyclists and other drivers who share the street with the cars testing ""full self-driving.""Tesla did not respond to a request for comment and generally does not engage with the professional news media.Tesla drivers will have to make a privacy trade. Drivers who want early access to the technology must agree to allow Tesla to collect data on their driving style, and judge it.  Here's a rundown of common questions about the technology: What is ""full self-driving?""Tesla claimed in 2016 that all of its new vehicles had the hardware capability for ""full self-driving"" and that it would soon offer the complementary software to make the cars drive themselves.  Musk has said that he thinks people will be able to fall asleep in Teslas as they drive. He's spoken of a future that includes a million robotaxis and Teslas driving themselves across the country. But the available version of ""full self-driving"" is a far cry from those ambitious claims and it requires drivers to remain vigilant. Drivers who have used early versions of ""full self-driving"" have had to intervene to prevent their cars from crashing into things or driving on the wrong side of the road. Sometimes the drivers have praised the technology, other times they criticize it as no better than a drunk driver. Many have said the technology appears to be generally improving over time. Even so, ""full self-driving"" may handle a situation perfectly, but then fail the next time it faces the same situation.Tesla is rolling out access to ""full self-driving"" as its customers have grown frustrated and tired of waiting years for the technology. Some are increasingly skeptical of Musk's claims.Even Tesla has drivers signing up for the technology acknowledge that ""FSD Beta does not make my car autonomous.""Most autonomous vehicle experts believe that full self-driving means a car in which a person could safely fall asleep behind the wheel, and no attentive human driver is needed. Regulators have repeatedly criticized Tesla's use of the term ""full self-driving.""So far their actions have been more bark than bite. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has said repeatedly in statements that there are no vehicles available for sale that can drive themselves. But driver-assist systems like Autopilot and ""full self-driving"" are not currently regulated, so Tesla and other automakers can deploy whatever driver-assist technology they want. There are signals this may change.NHTSA has launched an investigation into Teslas on Autopilot rear-ending emergency vehicles stopped in the roadway. The administration has also requested extensive data from automakers on their driver-assist system, and the tough talk has continued.""Tesla is putting untrained drivers on public roads as testers for their misleadingly-named, unproven system—a seeming recipe for disaster,"" U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT.) said Sunday. ""Serious safety concerns should put this reckless plan in reverse. It's Russian Roulette for unsuspecting drivers & the public.""Blumenthal has called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Tesla's autonomous driving features, and cheered the NHTSA investigation.How is Tesla deciding what drivers will get access to ""full self-driving?""Tesla announced Saturday a ""safety score,"" which it says will estimate the likelihood that a driver could be in a collision. The safety score will track hard braking, aggressive turning, tailgating, forward collision warnings and Autopilot disengagements, according to Tesla. (Autopilot generally refers to Tesla's more rudimentary suite of driver assist features like traffic-aware cruise control.)Musk has said that drivers will be granted access to the ""full self-driving"" beta if their driving is ""good"" for seven days. People who have shared Tesla safety scores on social media so far have offered a range of reviews. Many welcomed and embraced the scores. Some have expressed surprise at how high their score was given their driving style, while others have said the score seemed lo","Tesla is rolling out its ""full self-driving"" software to its customers.

The case was decided by an eight-person jury in San Francisco which included one Black juror, according to Lawrence Organ, Diaz's attorney.Tesla did not respond to a question about whether it intends to appeal, which can only be filed after some post-trial motions. David Oppenheimer, a professor and director of the Center on Comparative Equality and Anti-Discrimination Law at the University of California Berkeley, said he believes it is the largest monetary award to a single plaintiff for racial harassment.""Owen Diaz stood up to one of the richest companies in the country and the jury heard him and believed him and sent a message to Tesla that what it did was wrong,"" Organ said. In a blog post on the company website Monday, the head of Tesla's human resources department said the automaker strongly believes ""these facts don't justify the verdict."" ""We do recognize that in 2015 and 2016 we were not perfect. We're still not perfect,"" said the post by Valerie Capers Workman, Tesla's vice president, people.  ""But we have come a long way from 5 years ago. We continue to grow and improve in how we address employee concerns.""Workman, who is Black, wrote that there were no witnesses to Diaz being called the n-word. And she claimed that although witnesses testified that they ""regularly heard racial slurs (including the n-word) on the Fremont factory floor,"" she said ""that most of the time they thought the language was used in a 'friendly' manner and usually by African-American colleagues.""Organ described Workman's claims about how the racial epithet was used as ""preposterous and shows you the lack of sensitivity at Tesla.""""They need to clean up their act,"" he said. ""Our hope is this verdict will make them wake up and do something.""Diaz was not directly employed by Tesla (TSLA) but worked for an outside contractor at the plant in 2015 and 2016. However the jury found that he was a joint employee of Tesla and the contractor.Workman referred to Diaz in her post as an ""elevator operator."" Organ said that is an attempt to diminish Diaz's work since his duties included using a fork lift to move key parts between factory floors. Diaz, 53, is now working as a bus driver in Oakland, Organ said.Workman also claimed that Diaz did not complain about the use of the n-word until after he was not hired full-time by Tesla — and after he hired an attorney. She also said that all three times Diaz complained about harassment, Tesla stepped in and made sure responsive and timely action was taken by the staffing agencies, resulting in two contractors being fired and one who had drawn a racially insensitive cartoon being suspended.But Organ said Tesla never introduced proof of those contractors' dismissals in court or during the discovery process.

Organ also represented Berry.Tesla now requires all contractors working at the plant to also agree to have disputes settled by arbitration rather than in court, Organ said. But he has another federal suit which he is attempting to have certified as a class action case against Tesla also alleging racial harassment.

Musk said Thursday that there is a ""limit to how big you can scale in the Bay area.""He cited housing affordability and the long commutes it can create as hurdles for its current location, and said the Austin factory is five minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from downtown. The median home price in Palo Alto is $3.3 million, according to Realtor.com, whereas the median home price in Austin is $588,000.Musk himself said in December that he moved to Texas, and one of his other companies, SpaceX, is developing a massive rocket system known as ""Starship"" in South Texas.Despite the move, Musk said Tesla (TSLA) plans to continue to ""significantly"" expand in California.""This is not a matter of, sort of, Tesla leaving California,"" he said. He added that the company intended to increase output from its Fremont and Nevada factories by 50%.Tesla could not be reached for additional comment Thursday night. The company does not typically engage with traditional news media.Back in May 2020, Musk said in a series of tweets that Tesla would move the company's headquarters to Texas or Nevada. That came after a dispute between Musk and Alameda County, California, officials over the safety of Tesla's Fremont factory due to the coronavirus pandemic.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported when Elon Musk initially tweeted that Tesla would move its headquarters. Musk tweeted that intention in May 2020.","The electric car company is currently based in Palo Alto, California.

CNN,tesla,6,"Taxes, not Twitter, are the real reason Elon Musk might sell some Tesla shares",https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/investing/elon-musk-tesla-stock-sale-taxes-twitter/index.html?utm_content=2021-11-08T23%3A51%3A57&utm_term=link&utm_source=twCNN&utm_medium=social,"If and when Elon Musk sells a large chunk of his Tesla shares, it'll probably have relatively little to do with a Twitter poll among his loyal followers — and everything to do with a looming multi-billion-dollar tax bill.Musk published a Twitter poll over the weekend, noting that because he doesn't receive a cash salary he pays income tax only when he sells shares. And because ""much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance,"" he asked the Twitterverse if he should sell 10% of his shares. Some 58% of respondents said yes.The tweet got attention, as many of Musk's social media antics do. But the move is not really about a populist vote. The real reason is because Musk is just months out from a deadline to exercise the stock options he received years ago. If he doesn't use them, he loses them. And if he does exercise his shares, he's going to face a monster tax bill between nearly $11 billion to as much as $16 billion at current share prices.Continued increases in the value of Tesla stock could push his tax bill even higher. Shares of the EV maker, which rose 743% last year, are up another 68% so far this year — though they did drop 3% Monday following his weekend poll.Musk received the 22.9 million stock options in question as part of his 2012 compensation package. Those options are due to expire August 13, 2022, making them worthless unless Musk exercises them before the deadline. Once he exercises, however, those shares would be treated as regular income subject to income tax, said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting. In most cases, options like these, which are based on hitting performance numbers, are taxable not as income but instead at the lower capital gains rate. But Musk would face the income tax rate because of a special rule: He owns more than 10% of Tesla's total shares. The taxable income is calculated based on the market value of the stock on the exercise date, minus the price paid to exercise the options. At Monday's level, that taxable amount would be about $27 billion — and the top federal income tax rate is 37%, with another 3.8% net investment tax on top of that. So exercising would cost Musk nearly $11 billion today.Musk owns 170.5 million shares of Tesla stock outright, and he has options to buy another 73.5 million as of today including the ones expiring next year. He'll get even more if Tesla continues to grow and hits very achievable financial targets. The value of those shares and options comes to nearly $300 billion, making him the richest person in the world, but an analysis by ProPublica in June found Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018 — and in 2017 he paid only $65,000. ""Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock,"" Musk tweeted on Saturday. In June he tweeted a response to a tweet about his tax bill, saying that the ""only time I sell Tesla stock is when my stock options are expiring & I have no choice."" State taxes could add to his tax billMusk may also face state taxes on top of the federal bill.He did move his residence from California to Texas, which has no state income tax, compared to California's top rate of 13.3%. He has announced plans to also move Tesla's California headquarters to Texas.But he could be hit with at least some California state income tax, given that Tesla still has a major factory and offices in California and Musk still spends time working there. Musk acknowledged that in the June tweet: ""Btw, I will continue to pay income taxes in California proportionate to my time in state, which is & will be significant.""It's not clear what the final state tax bill would come to, as California may or may not try to tax all of Musk's proceeds from these expiring options since almost all of Tesla's operations were in the state when the original grant was made. An additional 13.3% state income tax would come to $3.6 billion. It's also possible Musk will receive additional options to buy 2.6 million more shares from that 2012 grant. Those options could be worth another $3 billion if he gets them by the August 2022 expiration date.A major stakeholder announcing plans to sell shares is rarely a good thing for a stock. But many analysts are still bullish on Tesla, predicting further price increases in the year ahead. Investors were already pricing in some stock sales by Musk due to the expected tax bill, said Daniel Ives, senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities.""With a tax bill that we calculate at north of $10 billion, selling stock over the coming months is not a surprise,"" Ives wrote in a note to clients Monday, ""although holding a Twitter poll to sell 10% of his stock is another bizarre soap opera that can only happen to one company and one CEO in the world.""","Elon Musk's Twitter poll shows 58% of respondents said he should sell 10% of his shares. If he doesn't exercise his stock options,","It was a public vote, he said he would honor the results and did. If he did the opposite of the poll you guys would still complain",He just wanted more attention.,Negative Anticipation,Neutral,Elon musk tweets about selling tenth of his wealth

Officials are grappling with the problem even as new incidents occur.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Alexandra E. Petri and Daniel E. SlotnikMaggie Cheng could stand to watch the video only once.“I’ve never cried like that before,” Ms. Cheng said, describing her reaction to security footage that showed her mother being shoved to the ground last week on a crowded street in Flushing, Queens. “To see my mother get thrown like that, she looks like a feather. She looks like a rag doll.”The attack on Ms. Cheng’s mother, which was highlighted by celebrities and gained widespread attention on social media, was one of four against Asian-American women in New York City that day. Taken together, they stoked fears that the wave of racism and violence that has targeted Asian-Americans during the pandemic was surging again in New York. Those concerns intensified after a man of Asian descent was stabbed Thursday night near Chinatown.The number of hate crimes with Asian-American victims reported to the New York Police Department jumped to 28 in 2020, from just three the previous year, though activists and police officials say many additional incidents were not classified as hate crimes or went unreported.Asian-Americans are grappling with the anxiety, fear and anger brought on by the attacks, which activists and elected officials say were fueled early in the pandemic by former President Donald J. Trump, who frequently used racist language to refer to the coronavirus.In New York City, where Asian-Americans make up an estimated 16 percent of the population, the violence has terrified many.“The attacks are random, and they are fast and furious,” said Jo-Ann Yoo, executive director of the Asian American Federation, a nonprofit network of community groups. “It has stoked a lot of fear and paranoia. People are not leaving their homes.”The xenophobia and violence is compounded by the economic fallout of the pandemic and fears of the virus, which dealt a severe blow to New York’s Asian-American communities.Many of the attacks do not result in hate crime charges, because the police need evidence that identity was the motivating factor, like an audible racial slur, a self-incriminating statement or a history of racist behavior by the attacker.So far this year, two attacks on people of Asian descent have led to hate crime charges in New York. Another appeared to come on Thursday, after a 36-year-old man was stabbed near the federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan and taken to the hospital in critical condition, the police said. The authorities initially said they would pursue hate crime charges, but on Saturday they had settled on several charges, none of them related to hate crimes, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation.A Police Department spokesman said the motives in last week’s attacks, including the one on Ms. Cheng’s mother, were unclear and that they were not currently being investigated as hate crimes.Leaders who have pressed elected officials and the police to confront the issue say the response so far has felt sluggish.“I’m really angry,” Ms. Yoo said. “I’ve been asking for something, some kind of a proactive response from City Hall.”Mayor Bill de Blasio said this week that the city was working to increase communication with community leaders, creating a website to help people report and respond to attacks, and focusing subway patrols on possible bias crimes. He also pointed to the Asian Hate Crime Task Force the department formed late last year.“If you dare to raise your hand against a member of our Asian communities, you will suffer the consequences,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference.Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo oversees the task force, which is composed of 25 volunteer detectives who speak 10 languages. He said it was designed to encourage Asian-Americans who are reluctant to cooperate with the police.“The sentiment within the Asian-American community is that the police either don’t care or are not doing enough,” he said.The N.Y.P.D. said it made arrests in 18 hate crimes involving Asian-American victims last year, and the cases are still pending.But many Asian-Americans feel that their complaints are not being taken seriously by the police and prosecutors, said Chris Kwok, a board member for the Asian American Bar Association of New York.“The political and social invisibility of Asian-Americans have real-life consequences,” Mr. Kwok said. “The invisibility comes from Asian-Americans being seen as permanent foreigners — they can’t cross that invisible line into becoming real Americans.”Several highly publicized incidents early in the pandemic were not handled as hate crimes, Mr. Kwok said. If they had been, it “would have sent a signal that this was unacceptable and that if you were going to target Asian-Americans","Hate crimes with Asian-American victims soared to 28 in 2020, from just three the previous year.

It’s un-American, and it must stop.”Asian-Americans have grappled with anxiety and fear as violence against them spiked during the pandemic. Activists and elected officials say the attacks were fueled early on in part by the rhetoric of former President Donald J. Trump, who frequently referred to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” because it originated in Wuhan, China. Mr. Trump has also blamed the Chinese government for the pandemic, saying Beijing failed to keep the virus from spreading beyond China’s borders.Over the past year, researchers and activist groups have tallied thousands of racist incidents against Asian-Americans. Earlier this year, an 84-year-old man from Thailand was violently slammed to the ground during an attack in San Francisco, and he later died. The killing, which his family described as racially motivated, spurred a campaign to raise awareness of his death and the recent attacks against Asian-Americans.In New York, the number of hate crimes involving Asian-American victims reported to the New York Police Department jumped to 28 in 2020, up from just three the previous year.","'They're forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America,' he said.

He said that early on, once we began the interviews with him. He claims that these, and as the chief said, we know this is still early, but he does claim that it was not racially motivated. He apparently has an issue, what he considers a sex addiction, and sees these locations as something that allows him to go to these places. And it is a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate.” “So obviously, whatever the motivation was for this guy, we know that many of the victims, the majority of the victims, were Asian. We also know that this is an issue that’s happening across the country. It is unacceptable. It is hateful, and it has to stop.” “We put out an image of a possible suspect very early on in this incident, and we were notified by his family, who were fully cooperative, and we are greatly appreciative of their assistance in this matter.”ACWORTH, Ga. — The man who police say went on a rampage at three spas in the Atlanta area, killing eight people, was charged on Wednesday with eight counts of murder in connection with the attacks.The brazen shootings, which took the lives of six women of Asian descent, stirred considerable outrage and fear in the Asian-American community. Investigators said they had not ruled out bias as a motivating factor even as the suspect denied such racial animus once in custody.The suspect told the police that he had a “sexual addiction” and had carried out the shootings at the massage parlors to eliminate his “temptation,” the authorities said on Wednesday. He also said that he had frequented massage parlors in the past and launched the attacks as a form of vengeance. All but one of the victims were women, the police said.Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta said that regardless of the determination about motive, the tragedy was clear.“Whatever the motivation was for this guy, we know that the majority of the victims were Asian,” Ms. Bottoms said. “We also know that this is an issue that is happening across the country. It is unacceptable, it is hateful and it has to stop.”The authorities charged Robert Aaron Long, 21, on Wednesday with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault in connection with the shootings. Four of the murder counts and the assault charge stem from the first shooting, in Cherokee County, and the other four murder counts relate to the shootings at two spas in the city of Atlanta less than an hour later, the authorities said.Capt. Jay Baker of the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office said that Mr. Long had told the police he was driving to Florida when he was caught after the shootings on Tuesday evening, and that he said he may have been trying to commit similar violence at a business connected to the “porn industry” there. He was stopped after his parents alerted the police that they believed their son might be the suspect, and the police were able to track his phone.Sheriff Frank Reynolds of Cherokee County said the suspect may have “frequented these places in the past and may have been lashing out.”The police arrested Mr. Long, who is white, about 150 miles south of Atlanta after a manhunt, the authorities said. They had earlier released a surveillance image of a suspect near a Hyundai Tucson outside one of the massage parlors. Mr. Baker said that Mr. Long, of Cherokee County, had admitted to the shootings and that he appeared to be acting alone.Rodney Bryant, the acting chief of the Atlanta Police Department, said it was not yet clear whether the shooting spree would be classified as a hate crime.“We are still early in this investigation, so we cannot make that determination at this moment,” Chief Bryant said. “We are just not there as of yet.”By Scott ReinhardFour people died in the first shooting, at Young’s Asian Massage near Acworth, a northwest suburb of Atlanta, Mr. Baker said.

NYT,Asian hate crimes,4,Why Some Georgia Lawmakers Want Last Week’s Shootings Labeled Hate Crimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/us/politics/georgia-hate-crime-atlanta-shootings.html,"Violence that left eight dead, including six women of Asian descent, will be the first stress test for a Georgia hate crime law.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Astead W. Herndon and Stephanie SaulA year ago, Georgia was one of four states that had no hate crime legislation.But the deadly rampage last week that left eight people dead, six of them women of Asian descent, is now providing a test of a law passed last year — and a window into the way that the state’s increasingly diverse electorate has altered its political and cultural chemistry.Georgia, after earlier false starts, passed its legislation following the shooting death of a young Black man, Ahmaud Arbery, who was stopped, detained and then shot to death by white residents in a South Georgia suburban neighborhood.Now last week’s shootings, in which Robert Aaron Long, 21, has been charged with eight counts of murder, are providing a major stress test for when the legislation can be applied, what it can achieve and how it plays into the state’s increasingly polarized politics.Political leaders, civil rights activists, and national and local elected officials condemned last week’s attack as an act of bigoted terror, drawing a connection between the majority-Asian victims and a recent surge in hate crimes against Asian and Pacific Islander Americans.Law enforcement officials and some legal figures have shied away from labeling the killings a hate crime, saying there is insufficient evidence of motivation. Prosecutors in two separate counties are still weighing whether to invoke the hate crimes law.But that has not stopped the shootings from resonating as bias crimes for many in Georgia, a state that has been at the forefront of the demographic changes coursing through the South.“I don’t want to draw any conclusions, but it’s obvious to me that if six victims were Asian women, that was a target,” said Georgia State Representative Calvin Smyre, a longtime Democratic lawmaker who helped shepherd the hate crimes bill through the General Assembly.In recent years, Georgia has been a microcosm of the racial divides that have affected the entire country.Last February, the killing of Mr. Arbery, 25, ignited a national outcry, particularly after law enforcement officials initially failed to make any arrests following his death near Brunswick, Ga.In the aftermath of last week’s killings, the response from law enforcement was criticized once again, after a spokesman for the sheriff’s department in suburban Cherokee County, where one of the attacks took place, downplayed the role of anti-Asian racism in the shooting there. Instead, he attributed the suspect’s motivation to sex addiction — the gunman’s own characterization — and the fact that he had been having “a really bad day.”Political leaders, especially in Atlanta, have gone much further, characterizing the events as domestic terrorism and, at least in part, motivated by a web of racial and misogynistic intolerance. President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Georgia on Friday, casting the shootings in the context of broader abuse and intolerance directed at people of Asian descent.But absent clear evidence of the shooter’s intent, there is broad division on whether there are sufficient grounds for adding hate crime charges.Representative Sam Park, a Democratic member of the Georgia House and the state’s only Korean-American legislator, said it is impossible to separate the crime from the anti-Asian bias and violence that has surged over the past year.“Regardless of the motive of the perpetrator, we very much feel like this is an attack on our community. Condolences are good. Words of sympathy are great — but actions are necessary.”But Byung J. Pak, a Republican, Korean-American and former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, urged caution before linking the killings to a hate crime before the investigation is completed.“Prejudging the case before the completion of the investigation puts pressure on prosecutors to perhaps file charges which may not hold up in court, or raise expectations that cannot be satisfied,” Mr. Pak said. “I would be cautious designating this crime as a hate crime until the investigation is complete.”Racist violence has a particular sting in the American South, considering the region’s long arc of racial discrimination. Though it is often framed in the familiar context of Black-white community relations, a dramatic increase in Asian and Latino populations has also shifted the state’s political and cultural composition.The General Assembly approval of the state’s current hate crime legislation last year in the wake of Mr. Arbery’s death reflected an increasingly purple electorate, as well as pressure from the business community. Three white men have since been charged in connection with his death.Efforts to pass the hate crime legislation were led by Representative Chuck","Violence that left eight dead, including six women of Asian descent, will be the first stress test for a Georgia hate crime law.

But the criminal justice system has faced challenges in definitively proving racist motives in apparent anti-Asian crimes. Some advocates have pointed to shortcomings in the laws that govern hate crimes.Acknowledging the spate of violence, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday pledged that the city would increase the police presence in Asian communities and encouraged people to report crimes.“It sickens me, and it angers me, and we will deal with it aggressively,” he said at a news conference. “I want everyone, in every way you can, to help support our Asian-American neighbors, speak up for them, help report anything you see.”While it is difficult to measure the extent of the recent violence against people of Asian descent, in part because many crimes go unreported, the number of police investigations into hate crimes has gone up this year, compared with the same period last year.Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea, during an interview with Pix11 on Thursday before the recent attacks, said the department was investigating 10 anti-Asian hate crimes reported through mid-March, compared to none in early 2020 before the pandemic reached New York.The department recorded 29 anti-Asian attacks last year, including 25 that investigators believed stemmed from anti-Asian sentiment and the perception that the victim was carrying the coronavirus, according to police statistics released in January.The Police Department created a unit last year under its hate crimes task force that is specifically focused on hate crimes against people of Asian descent.“It’s very important that we find people who do this and take them off the streets,” Mr. de Blasio said on Monday.George O’krepkie, a witness to the assault, said the attacker threw what appeared to be a crumpled-up newspaper at the victim before charging at him and yelling a racial slur. “He was on top of him,” he said. “Within seconds there was blood everywhere.”The victim was taken to NewYork-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital in critical but stable condition. It was not clear if he had been released, but a man who answered the phone number listed for the victim declined to comment.Mr. Mathieu was arraigned on Monday on one count of second-degree assault, and prosecutors, who ultimately determine whethe",Three of the attacks took place between Friday and Sunday in New York City.

Staff members at the building who witnessed the attack and did not intervene have been suspended, the building’s management company said.The attacker, whom the police department’s hate crimes task force asked for the public’s help in identifying, stomped on the woman’s upper body and head at least three times after she fell to the ground.The victim was hospitalized at NYU Langone Medical Center in Manhattan with what the police described as serious injuries. Further information about her condition was not immediately available.The Manhattan attack is the latest in a yearlong surge of anti-Asian violence seen across the country and in New York City. The growing list of assaults also come as people mourn a shooting in the Atlanta area earlier this month that left eight people dead, including six women of Asian descent.The video, which was released by the police and drew widespread attention online, showed a man who appeared to be a building worker standing in the lobby, unwilling to intervene. He then closed the building’s front door while the woman was lying on the ground after the attacker walked off.Warning: Video shows a violent attack.Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference on Tuesday morning that the video of the attack was “absolutely disgusting and outrageous.” He added that it was “absolutely unacceptable” that no one intervened or came to the woman’s aid.“I don’t care who you are, I don’t care what you do, you’ve got to help your fellow New Yorker,” Mr. de Blasio said.The Brodsky Organization, the management company for the luxury apartment building, said in a statement that the staff members who witnessed the attack “have been suspended pending an investigation in conjunction with their union,” and that it was trying to identify a delivery vendor who was in the lobby.After the release of the video, the company was widely criticized online over its workers’ failure to intervene.“The Brodsky Organization condemns all forms of discrimination, racism, xenophobia and violence against the Asian-American community,” the company said in its statement.The attack represented another jarring reminder of the rise in violent crimes targeting people of Asian descent across the United States, which advocates say has been exacerbated by pandemic-related racism. Members of the Asian-American community have been sounding the alarm on the wave of xenophobia and violence targeting their community for months.The assault on the woman in Midtown Manhattan also came as hate crimes investigators said they were investigating the subway beating of a man on a busy J train in Brooklyn, an attack that was recorded by another passenger in a TikTok video that has been viewed millions of times.The unidentified attacker, who was still at large, punched the man repeatedly and put him in a chokehold until the man became unconscious. The timing of the attack and the nature of the victim’s injuries were not immediately clear.Juliana Kim, Jeffery C.

NYT,Asian hate crimes,7,Senate Resoundingly Passes Bill to Target Anti-Asian Hate Crimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/us/politics/senate-anti-asian-hate-crimes.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes,"The bipartisan vote was the first legislative action either chamber of Congress has taken to bolster law enforcement’s response to rising attacks on the Asian-American community.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Catie EdmondsonWASHINGTON — The Senate overwhelmingly approved legislation on Thursday aimed at strengthening federal efforts to address hate crimes directed at Asian-Americans amid a sharp increase in discrimination and violence against Asian communities in the United States.The bipartisan vote, 94 to 1, was the first legislative action either chamber of Congress has taken to bolster law enforcement’s response to attacks on people of Asian descent, which have intensified during the coronavirus pandemic.“By passing this bill, the Senate makes it very clear that hate and discrimination against any group has no place in America,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader. “By passing this bill, we say to the Asian-American community that their government is paying attention to them, has heard their concerns and will respond to protect them.”The measure, sponsored by Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, would establish a position at the Justice Department to expedite the agency’s review of hate crimes and expand the channels to report them. It would also encourage the creation of state-run hate crime hotlines, provide grant money to law enforcement agencies that train their officers to identify hate crimes and introduce a series of public education campaigns around bias against people of Asian descent.The legislation will next go to the House, where lawmakers passed a resolution last year condemning anti-Asian discrimination related to the pandemic. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California pledged on Thursday shortly after the bill’s passage to put it to a vote on the House floor next month, calling it a catalyst for “robust, impactful action.”“I cannot tell you how important this bill is” to the Asian-American community, “who have often have felt very invisible in our country; always seen as foreign, always seen as the other” said Ms. Hirono, the first Asian-American woman elected to the chamber and one of only two currently serving there. “We stand with you and will continue to stand with you to prevent these kinds of crimes from happening our country.”The legislation marshaled a level of support rarely seen in the bitterly divided Congress — even on issues as straightforward as addressing a spate of racially motivated crimes. The lopsided vote reflected the will in both parties to respond to the rash of violence against Asian-Americans, and a determination among rank-and-file senators to show that they could work across partisan lines to reach consensus on legislation and steer clear of a filibuster.Republicans had initially offered a lukewarm response to the bill. But they rallied around an amended version after Ms. Hirono worked behind the scenes with Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, to secure enough Republican support to win 60 votes. That included adding a section explicitly documenting and denouncing attacks against Asian-Americans, as well as the provision establishing the hate crime hotlines, proposed by Senators Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, and Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas.Ms. Collins took to the Senate floor on Thursday to urge her colleagues to support the legislation, calling on them to join her in sending “an unmistakably strong signal that crimes targeting Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders in our country will not be tolerated.”Citing those revisions, Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said he would reverse his position on the measure and support it. Language in the original bill did not once refer to the Asian-American community but instead mentioned victims of “Covid-19 hate crimes,” Mr. Cotton said, adding that an earlier provision directed federal agencies to issue guidance advising what kind of terms to use in describing the pandemic, a move he said was too prescriptive.Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, was the lone opponent of the legislation, arguing that it mandated an overly expansive collection of data around hate crimes that could slide into government overreach.Democrats defeated a roster of amendments proposed by Republicans, including one aimed at banning federal funds for universities that discriminate against Asian-Americans — something that is already unlawful. Another would have required a report on how the government had enforced restrictions on gatherings for religious worship during the pandemic, and a third would have prohibited the Justice Department from tracking cases of discrimination that did not rise to the level of a crime. Ms. Hirono dismissed the amendments as “damaging” and partisan.Legislative efforts and debates around the spike of violence targeting Asian-Americans have not always pro","The bipartisan vote, 94 to 1, was the first legislative action either chamber of Congress has taken to bolster law enforcements response to attacks on","I’m happy for my people, but now do this for the main people racially profiled and hurt in this country.

Anyone can read what you share.By Michael GoldThe man suspected of assaulting a 61-year-old Asian immigrant in East Harlem on Friday night, leaving him on a ventilator and in a coma, was arrested and charged with a hate crime on Tuesday, the police said.The victim, Yao Pan Ma, was pushing a grocery cart full of bottles and cans near 125th Street and Third Avenue when he was attacked suddenly from behind and collapsed onto the sidewalk, the police said.A video released by the Police Department showed Mr. Ma’s attacker stomping on his head and kicking him multiple times in the face before running away, the authorities said. He remained in a coma and on a ventilator after the attack, his wife, Baozhen Chen, told local news outlets.The suspect, Jarrod Powell, 49, was arrested and charged with attempted murder and two counts of assault as a hate crime. The police initially said they had charged Mr. Powell with two counts of assault, but they upgraded the charges on Tuesday afternoon.The attack brought a new wave of fear and anger after a number of similar unprovoked assaults on Asian New Yorkers in recent months.Reports of hate crimes targeting Asian-Americans have increased sharply across the country since the coronavirus pandemic began last year, when former President Donald J. Trump repeatedly used anti-Asian slurs to refer to the virus in an effort to link it to China.Law enforcement officials nationwide have said that attackers in some cases have used language falsely blaming Asian-Americans for spreading the virus.The New York Police Department had received 66 reports of anti-Asian hate crimes this year as of last Sunday, the most recent day for which data was available, a spokeswoman said. That’s more than five times the 12 incidents reported in the same period last year, and more than double the 28 recorded in all of 2020.Police officials have said that more victims appeared to be reporting anti-Asian attacks than in the past. Community advocates have said that anti-Asian crimes have long been underreported because of language barriers and distrust of the police.Experts testifying at a congressional hearing on anti-Asian discrimination last month said attacks targeting Asian-Americans had increased nearly 150 percent nationwide in the past year. Last week, the Senate passed a bill that would boost federal, state and local efforts to address such attacks.But many incidents, in New York City and elsewhere, have not led to arrests or have not been charged as hate crimes. Asian-American leaders have expressed outrage, questioning whether assaults against Asian victims were being overlooked by law-enforcement agencies.In New York State, to charge attacks like the one against Mr. Ma as hate crimes, prosecutors must show that the victims were targeted because of their race. Experts have said that proving a racist motive can be particularly difficult in attacks against Asians, in part because there is no widely recognized symbol of anti-Asian hate.Last month, a Filipino-American woman walking to church was shoved to the ground and kicked. Footage of the attack went viral, and her assailant was charged with a hate crime after investigators determined that he shouted disparaging racist remarks at her.But hate-crime charges have not been brought in several other incidents involving victims like her and Mr. Ma — middle-aged New Yorkers who were alone on the streets or riding public transit.On Monday, before Mr. Powell’s arrest, a police spokesman said surveillance camera footage suggested that Mr. Ma and his attacker had not interacted before the assault, leading detectives to believe Mr. Ma may have been targeted because of his race.A police spokesman would not provide more details about what led officials to charge Mr. Powell with a hate crime, citing the ongoing investigation.The increase in attacks has been particularly troubling in New York City, where people of Asian descent make up an estimated 14 percent of the population and which has been a longtime hub for Asian immigrants seeking to start new lives in the United States.Mr. Ma and Ms. Chen were among them, she told The Daily News. The couple moved to New York City in 2019 from China’s Guangdong province, leaving their two adult children behind.A pastry chef in China, Mr. Ma was able to secure work at a Chinatown restaurant, Ms. Chen said. But he lost his job because of the pandemic’s crushing effects on the economy and was not eligible for benefits, so he began collecting bottles and cans in a shopping cart as a way to bring in extra money.“He was just trying to help out the family,” Ms. Chen told The Daily News, speaking in Cantonese. “He had no bad intentions. He wouldn’t cause trouble with other people in his neighborhood.”Ms. Chen, who works a","A Chinese immigrant collecting bottles and cans was stomped and kicked in the head.

WP,Asian hate crimes,1,Attacks on Asian Americans during pandemic renew criticism that U.S. undercounts hate crimes,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/asian-american-hate-crimes/2021/02/21/c28a8e04-72d9-11eb-b8a9-b9467510f0fe_story.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=wp_main,"A spate of high-profile assaults on Asian Americans has renewed long-standing criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups that the U.S. government is vastly undercounting hate crimes, a problem that they say has grown more acute amid rising white nationalism and deepening racial strife. The attacks — including several in Northern California over the past month that attracted national attention — followed months of warnings from advocates that anti­-China rhetoric from former president Donald Trump over the coronavirus pandemic was contributing to a surge in anti-Asian slurs and violence.Although President Biden last month signed an executive action banning the federal government from employing the sort of “inflammatory and xenophobic” language Trump used to describe the virus — such as “China plague” and “kung flu” — Asian American leaders said the recent attacks demonstrate a need for greater urgency in dealing with such threats.Among other incidents, Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old San Francisco resident who had emigrated from Thailand, was killed in late January, in a brazen attack captured on a video that went viral on social media. Antoine Watson, a 19-year-old African American man, was charged in connection with Ratanapakdee’s death and has pleaded not guilty.Biden administration officials said they are working to address the problem, pointing to a section in the executive memo that instructed the Justice Department to expand its reporting, tracking and prosecutions of “hate incidents.” Officials said those efforts could go beyond hate crimes to include episodes of harassment and discrimination.During his Senate confirmation hearing Monday, Merrick Garland, Biden’s nominee for attorney general, pledged to support such efforts.“Hate crimes tear at the fabric of our society. They make our citizens worried about walking the streets and exercising even the most normal rights,” Garland said. “The role of the [Justice Department’s] Civil Rights Division is to prosecute those cases vigorously, and I can ensure you that it will if I am confirmed.”A 1990 federal law mandates that the FBI collect data specifically on hate crimes each year, but the effort has long been plagued by incomplete and inconsistent data provided by the nation’s estimated 18,000 state, municipal and tribal law enforcement agencies.The administration is in the early stages of identifying strategies to compel broader participation. Among the ideas advocates have pushed for is tying federal funding from the Justice Department’s extensive grant programs to increased training and reporting on hate crimes.In 2019, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a report recommending Congress adopt legislation to provide funding for incentives and calling on local police to establish dedicated hate-crime units. Catherine E. Lhamon, who chaired that commission, now serves as deputy director for racial justice and equity on the White House domestic policy council.At a news conference last week, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), chair of the Asian Pacific American Caucus, said she is requesting a meeting with Justice Department leaders to discuss what she called a “crisis point” for the Asian American community in dealing with “an alarming surge of anti-Asian bigotry across the nation.”Chu added that the 1990 law on reporting of hate crime data “doesn’t have any teeth” because it does not compel localities to comply or to do so in a consistent and thorough manner.Last fall, the FBI reported 7,314 hate crimes nationwide in 2019, the most in a decade — but experts said the statistics were woefully inadequate because too few local law enforcement agencies fully participate in federal data collection efforts.The FBI said that 15,588 law enforcement organizations participated in the 2019 hate crimes study, but just 2,172 agencies reported the total number of incidents contained in the report. Civil rights advocates called that scenario implausible, pointing out that the entire state of Alabama reported no hate crimes to the FBI in both 2018 and 2019.“The FBI reports help us identify trends, but their data is so woefully inadequate that it can’t be relied on for much,” said civil rights lawyer Arjun Singh Sethi, author of “American Hate: Survivors Speak Out.”Some big-city law enforcement agencies have publicly reported an increase in bias attacks against Asian Americans. For example, New York City’s hate crimes task force investigated 27 incidents in 2020, including 24 tied to the coronavirus, a ninefold increase from the previous year.But experts said local police agencies lack training and funding to properly investigate hate crimes, and many treat it as a low priority. Some conservative Republicans have opposed more stringent reporting requirements to determine whether crimes are motivated by hate, arguing that such measures are redundant.Yet advocates have pointed to a 2013 study from the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics that found an av",A spate of high-profile assaults on Asian Americans has renewed long-standing criticism.

WP,Asian hate crimes,2,Anti-Asian attacks rise along with online vitriol,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/17/anti-asian-attacks-shootings/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_main,"The fatal shootings of six Asian women in Georgia on Tuesday have turned a spotlight on a disturbing trend of the past year: Crimes against people of Asian descent have risen sharply in the United States, along with online slurs blaming them for the coronavirus pandemic.Authorities say they are not certain, at this point, that the alleged shooter, Robert Aaron Long, 21, was motivated by racial animus. But the broader trend of hateful words and deeds against Asians and Asian Americans is clear, researchers say, and appears to have spiked since the November presidential election and the contentious months that followed.Terms including “China,” “Wuhan” and “flu” surged on far-right forums on Telegram, 8kun and TheDonald.win as former president Donald Trump pushed baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud, according to data tracked by the Network Contagion Research Institute, which monitors misinformation and online extremism. The terms were used on those platforms 44 percent more in January than in the average month last year.While the exact relationship between these terms and allegations of election fraud is not clear, the researchers theorize that rising political polarization fueled harsh talk online, as did xenophobia and the quest for scapegoats, including people of Asian descent.“The election has corresponded with a resurgence of anti-Asian hate,” said Joel Finkelstein, the co-founder of the Network Contagion Research Institute, which first reported on rising anti-Asian animus in April. “There are a lot of people looking for others to blame.”Suspect charged with eight counts of murder in killings at Atlanta-area spas, authorities sayHate crimes against Asian Americans in 16 of America’s biggest cities climbed 150 percent last year, with a spike in March and April, according to research earlier this month from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University at San Bernardino, which analyzed official police data.The suspected gunman told police that the shooting was not racially motivated, and he may have frequented the spas, Cherokee County Sheriff’s Capt. Jay Baker said Wednesday. The suspect’s “possible sexual addiction” appeared to be a factor, another official said, calling it “a temptation he wanted to eliminate.”But to some researchers, activists and members of the Asian American community, the violent attack — in which a White gunman targeted predominantly Asian women — also seemed to fit a pattern of sexist and xenophobic language online, which has often dehumanized Asian women as objects for sexual fixation or exotic fetishization.Charissa Cheah, a University of Maryland Baltimore County professor who has studied Asian American discrimination, said the “racialization” of the pandemic as the “China flu” has led to Asian Americans being targeted for real-world abuse.The discriminatory language, she said, has historic roots in anti-Asian xenophobia, which has portrayed Chinese people as “disease-ridden threats to America.” But it is also reflective of the way Asian Americans have long been marginalized between conflicting dynamics of gender, class and power.“There are these conceptualizations in the U.S. of Asians as being not American enough, the perpetual foreigner, or the ‘model minority’ myth that portrays Asian Americans as having moved beyond discrimination, as having succeeded,” she said. Those views have dovetailed, she added, with “the sexualization and exoticization of Asian American females in a very disturbing way.”Asian Americans in Atlanta stunned by shootings as advocates demand action: ‘Everyone has heard enough words’The shootings at Young’s Asian Massage, Aromatherapy Spa and Gold Spa, which covered a roughly 30-mile stretch of the broader Atlanta area, left seven women and one man dead. Six of the victims were of Asian descent.Stop AAPI Hate, an advocacy group for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, in a report released before the shootings, said Tuesday that it had received more than 3,700 reports of anti-Asian verbal harassment, civil rights violations and physical assault over the last year.People reported being spat on, refused service and called demeaning slurs while shopping, in class or on the sidewalk. Women represented two-thirds of the reports; one said she had been told to “go back to Wuhan” and called a “Thai wh---.”The group said in a statement after the shootings that they “will only exacerbate the fear and pain that the Asian American community continues to endure.”TheDonald’s owner speaks out on why he finally pulled plug on hate-filled siteThe police have given no indication that the spas were connected to illegal activity, and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) said Wednesday that they were “legally operating businesses that have not been on our radar.”But Asian spas have long been a punchline for racist stereotypes, sexist jokes and accusations of prostitution.On far-right online forums, users on Wednesday wavered betwe","Terms including China, Wuhan and flu surged on far-right forums on far-right",The other underlining issues is that these establishments are being used as brothels and sex trafficking people from other countries,There is zero evidence this has anything to do with race and media is purposely doing this,Negative Disgust Sadness,Neutral ,Asian-American attacks rises in near time

Elliot faces two counts of second-degree assault and one count of attempted first-degree assault that could carry a maximum sentence of 25 years, as well as other punishments for violating his parole, authorities said.The beating was captured on lobby surveillance video from a condominium, which showed several onlookers failing to respond to Kari’s distress. One closed the lobby door as she lay just outside on the pavement.“This brave woman belongs here. Asian American New Yorkers belong here. Everyone belongs here,” Vance said at a news conference. “Attacks against Asian American New Yorkers are attacks against all New Yorkers. Our office stands against hate in all its forms.”The assault caused widespread outrage as another in a rash of high-profile attacks on people of Asian descent, including the mass shooting in Atlanta that left six female Asian workers and two others dead in March, and the fatal assault, also captured on video, of an elderly Thai immigrant in San Francisco in February. The alleged assailants in those cases have not been charged with hate crimes, illustrating the complexities surrounding how such cases are handled.Covid fueled anti-Asian racism. Now elderly Asian Americans are being attacked.Vance and New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea hailed the quick work of the police department’s hate-crimes investigative unit in Elliot’s case, saying it demonstrated the commitment of the city’s law enforcement leadership to stopping such attacks. Vance said his office has prosecuted four hate-crime cases and is actively investigating four others in the first three months of this year, after having brought nine cases in all of 2020.“Let me reiterate that we will never accept or tolerate hate or violence of any kind in our great city,” Shea said. “It goes against every fiber of who we are.”The Midtown case was one of two attacks on Asian Americans in New York that were caught on video and publicized Monday, the other involving an Asian man who was choked and left unconscious in an altercation with a man on a subway car.The charges against Elliot came a day after the Biden administration announced steps to respond to mounting pressure from Asian American leaders, including an expedited 30-day internal review at the Justice Department aimed at bolstering the federal agency’s tracking and prosecutions of hate crimes and bias incidents. Other measures included reinstating a White House initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) and allocating nearly $50 million in new grants at the Department of Health and Human Services to assist survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault with new AAPI outreach.Yet some Asian American leaders, while praising officials for seeking to hold perpetrators accountable, cautioned that the Elliot case highlights the complicated nature of hate-crime attacks and said the quick legal charges should not be viewed as a panacea in dealing with the accounts of increasing racism and xenophobia.“I will say, and I do say to community leaders whether they like it or not, that even if we lock up every perpetrator and charge them with hate crimes it will not solve the problem,” said Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.), who had decried the attack as an example of Asian Americans being treated as “subhuman.”Raised to identify as Black, Harris steps into role as a voice for Asian Americans amid rise in hate incidentsMeng said she was pleased that attention and resources are moving toward developing a response to the issue of racism directed at Asian Americans. And she and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), have introduced the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act that would require the Justice Department to appoint an official to conduct an expedited review of every incident reported to federal hate-crime portals, as well as bolster data collection and public education campaigns around the coronavirus.“Every case is different, this is a complicated problem, and the solution won’t be a simple solution,” Meng said. “In this case, the attack was caught on video with the added layer of bystanders seeing it and doing nothing. This really evoked a lot of emotions in people.

The suspect is already on lifetime parole for murdering his mother, police said.Brandon Elliot, 38, was arrested at 1:10 a.m. Wednesday in Manhattan, the NYPD said in a statement shared with The Washington Post, and charged with felony assault as a hate crime. Elliot was convicted of murder in 2002, WNBC reported.The attack intensified calls for an end to anti-Asian hate crimes in the city and raised harsh criticism for three bystanders caught on video inside a luxury condo building’s lobby who witnessed the attack but did not intervene.“I don’t care who you are, I don’t care what you do, you’ve got to help your fellow New Yorker,” Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said, calling the bystanders’ actions “absolutely unacceptable.”The company that manages the condo tower announced Tuesday that the staffers involved in the incident have been suspended.“The staff who witnessed the attack have been suspended pending an investigation in conjunction with their union,” the Brodsky Organization wrote in an Instagram post, which also noted the company is trying to identify a “third-party vendor” who was also on the scene “so that appropriate action can be taken.”The case was one of two attacks on Asian Americans in New York that were caught on video and publicized Monday, on the same day that city leaders gathered in Brooklyn to urge quick action to halt a rising tide of racist violence and threats.“This is absolutely vile. These attacks against Asian-American New Yorkers must end,” New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson (D) said on Twitter, linking to a video of the attack on the woman. “Hate has no place here and we must always call it out when we see it.”In recent weeks, Asian Americans in New York have reported being punched in subway cars, spit on and pummeled with metal pipes — an ugly echo of a national trend that activists say gained traction as former president Donald Trump has used racist terms to tie the coronavirus pandemic to China.Monday’s attack happened just before noon in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood, police said, as the unidentified victim was walking along West 43rd Street. The woman was headed to church, WABC reported, when the attacker yelled, “F--- you, you don’t belong here,” and began assaulting her.The man kicked her in the stomach, knocking her to the sidewalk, and then brutally stomped on her head again and again.Video shows one man in the building’s lobby watching the entirety of the attack. That man, who appeared to be tying a stack of boxes onto a cart, stared out the glass doors as the woman was repeatedly kicked in the head, but made no move to assist her. Two other men, who were security guards according to WABC, then walked toward the entrance as the assailant left, and closed the door on the victim.The woman “sustained a serious physical injury,” the NYPD said, and was taken to NYU Langone Hospital, where she was in stable condition.After asking the public for help in identifying the assailant, the NYPD Hate Crime Task force announced Elliot’s arrest early Wednesday. He was convicted in 2002 of a vicious attack on his mother, Bridget Johnson, 42, according to a New York Daily News account at the time. Police said Elliot, then 19, had stabbed her three times in the heart with a kitchen knife, killing her.It’s not clear when he was paroled from prison in that case.The other attack on Monday remains unsolved. Video of the incident onboard a subway train shows an Asian man wearing a backpack being shoved by another passenger, who then starts punching him in the face repeatedly. Eventually, the passenger locks the man in a chokehold, tightly gripping his neck until he passes out on the floor of the train.“The NYPD is aware of this video and is investigating,” the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force said on Twitter on Monday morning.City officials, activists and celebrities this week decried the videos.“This is absolutely disgusting. Asian Americans belong in New York and are an integral part of our city,” tweeted Scott Stringer, New York City’s comptroller and a candidate for mayor. “We have to continue to speak out, we have to continue to protect our AAPI neighbors, and we have to act immediately to #StopAsianHate.”Others questioned the apparent lack of action from the bystanders in the lobby in the attack on the 65-year-old woman.“This is despicable. The attack and the guard’s inaction and closing the door on the victim,” tweeted actress Gemma Chan.Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.), who was among the officials calling for an end to anti-Asian hate crimes at the meeting in Brooklyn earlier on Monday, said the video reinforced a profound lack of empathy for Asian Americans.“We’ve gone from being invisible to being seen as sub-human,” Meng tweeted. “We just want to be seen as American like everyone else.”News: Increase in hate crimes | Victim voices","Brandon Elliot, 38, was charged with felony assault as a hate crime as a hate crime.

We cannot — we cannot — allow the recent tide of bigotry, intolerance and prejudice against Asian Americans go unchecked,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a floor speech just before the vote.The vote was 94 to 1. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) was the lone no vote.Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) introduced the bill last month, officially titled the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, based on a year’s worth of rising attacks after the pandemic began in Wuhan, China. Five days after Hirono introduced the legislation, eight people were killed, including six Asian women, in mass shootings at three Atlanta spas. The crimes heightened the pressure on Congress to respond to the rise in attacks against the Asian American community.Eight killed, including six Asian women, in Atlanta-area spa shootings; suspect arrested after manhunt“I cannot tell you how important this bill is to the AAPI community, who often has felt very visible in our country, always seen as the other. And for them to experience that kind of hatred against them,” Hirono told reporters after the legislation passed.With Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) as the lead House sponsor, the legislation would assign an official in the Justice Department to review and expedite all reports of hate crimes related to the coronavirus, expand support for local and state law enforcement agencies responding to these hate crimes, and issue guidance on mitigating the use of racially discriminatory language to describe the pandemic.Meng, in a statement after Thursday’s vote, said the House is expected to take up the legislation next month. President Biden has vowed to sign it when it reaches his desk.Republicans at first hesitated to adopt a position on the legislation, which carefully avoids any mention of former president Donald Trump’s comments about the “Kung Flu” and “the China virus” as possible inspiration for attacks on Asian Americans — but the inference is easily understood.In a rare bipartisan compromise, negotiators agreed to add a broader bill, the No Hate Act sponsored by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), to provide federal funding to conduct broader studies about the number of hate crimes every year.That decision cleared the way for last week’s initial vote to begin debate on the legislation, with 92 senators in support. Hirono and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) then spent several days negotiating the final details of the bill, which ended up more expansive than its original design and drew more support.“Senator Collins, I really appreciate your work on this bill. We would not be here without your support,” Hirono said during her speech.“Crimes motivated by bias against race, national origin, or other characteristics simply cannot be tolerated. Our amendment both denounces these acts and marshals additional resources toward addressing and stopping these despicable crimes,” Collins said in her floor speech.Their deal also assured that the Senate would reject three amendments offered by conservatives that would have been considered poison pills and brought down the entire legislation.Supporters of the legislation cited one study in 16 major cities, where hate crimes decreased overall in the past year but those crimes against Asian Americans soared 145 percent.At a news conference with Hirono and Schumer afterward, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) recalled regularly hearing the same phrase  — “Where are you from, really?” — even while serving in the Army.This legislation is needed, Duckworth said. “There’s a lot more work to be done. This is a good first step.”","The Senate overwhelmingly passes a bill designed to more forcefully investigate hate crimes.

WP,Asian hate crimes,6,"Erika Moritsugu, Biden’s new liaison to Asian Americans, fights for influence in the White House",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/erika-moritsugu-biden-asian-americans/2021/06/10/aa0d7c8a-c881-11eb-81b1-34796c7393af_story.html?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter,"The Korean American actor and activist Daniel Dae Kim was filming in Canada last month and unable to accept a White House invitation to join President Biden at a signing ceremony for an anti-Asian hate crimes bill. But this week, Kim slipped into Washington and joined a handful of presidential aides at the rooftop bar in the W Hotel, where Erika L. Moritsugu, a deputy assistant to Biden, pressed him into action.Moritsugu had arranged for Kim, an advisory council member of The Asian American Foundation (TAAF), to visit the White House on Tuesday for an informal lunch with staffers to discuss the newly formed organization, which has already raised more than $1 billion from the business community.Asked about his message, Kim replied: “Narrative change.” Moritsugu, 49, a Hawaii native of Japanese and Chinese descent, handed him a drink as Kim quizzed advocates over how to amplify information about mental health issues.Changing the narrative is what the happy hour was all about. Amid the spike in anti-Asian hate incidents during the coronavirus pandemic, members of Congress and community leaders have expressed anger that Asian Americans have been politically marginalized for decades, demanding more representation at the highest levels of the Biden administration and greater input into policymaking across the federal government.If Kim represents the Hollywood star power behind the effort, Moritsugu is at the center of Washington’s expanding political muscle.A veteran of the Obama administration and a former general counsel to Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Moritsugu was hired by the White House in April as the senior liaison to the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities amid an outcry from lawmakers and advocates frustrated that Biden failed to name a person of Asian descent to his statutory Cabinet.But if her appointment solved an urgent political problem — Duckworth and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) backed off a threat to block all of Biden’s nonminority nominees — it was less clear what her role would be and what she would be doing.“It was not well-defined because there is no playbook for the creation of a position like this,” Moritsugu said in an interview, describing her initial conversations with the White House. “There was a lot of inquiry and curiosity back and forth about what it would look like. I felt like the stakes are high and expectations are high.”Amid national attention on bias crimes, Asian American leaders struggle over where to take their movementThe playbook is still being written, largely on the fly. Moritsugu, who reports to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Bruce Reed, wrote a memo about how she would approach the job, aiming for input on a raft of policies, from combating hate crimes to ensuring fair housing, language access and educational opportunities. But she has quickly discovered how unpredictable life in the West Wing can be.A day after her appointment on April 14, Moritsugu was thrust into action as the White House’s representative to the Sikh community in Indianapolis after a gunman killed eight people, four of whom were Sikh, during a mass shooting at a FedEx facility.Moritsugu participated in an online vigil and then flew to the city to deliver a message to the community from Biden.In May, during Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, she took part in a panel discussion focused on anti-Asian hate with former NBA player Jeremy Lin at the State Department, and discussed the impact of the coronavirus on families during an online forum hosted by Olympian Michelle Kwan.And on May 20, she helped coordinate a pair of events that illustrated what advocates hailed as modest but concrete steps of progress. Biden presided over the East Room signing ceremony for the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act, introduced by Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) and Hirono, which aims to beef up the Justice Department’s tracking of hate incidents.Biden and Vice President Harris then joined TAAF board members — including Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang and Wall Street investors Joseph Bae and Li Lu — along with actress Olivia Munn and several grass-roots community leaders for a private meeting in the Roosevelt Room.“This is what the power of community looks like,” Biden told the group, according to people in attendance. He also found time to serenade Sonal Shah, a former Obama administration official who serves as TAAF president, with “Happy Birthday.”“There’s not yet been a typical day at the White House,” Moritsugu said. “It’s been a little more dynamic than that. Unexpected things crop up; long-term undertakings sometimes get put aside.”Moritsugu pointed to the rampant spread of the coronavirus in India as another unexpected challenge, as she fielded calls from influential Indian Americans seeking assistance from the Biden administration. She also helped arrange a speech by Harris, whose mother emigrated from southern India, to Indian American staffers at the State Department.“I asked her, ‘Are you sure",Asian Americans have been politically marginalized for decades. Erika Moritsugu is at the center of Washington's expanding political muscle. Moritsugu is,"Is she really ""fighting"" for influence? Or does she have a challenging job to do, like everyone else who works there?",Now the fight for a bigger slice of pie begins leaving White Supremacists even more threatened!,Positive Trust,Neutral ,Bill passed to handle Ant-Asian hate crime
WP,Asian hate crimes,7,"Hate crimes rise to highest level in 12 years amid increasing attacks on Black and Asian people, FBI says",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/hate-crimes-fbi-2020-asian-black/2021/08/30/28bede00-09a7-11ec-9781-07796ffb56fe_story.html,"The number of hate crimes in the United States rose in 2020 to the highest level in 12 years, propelled by increasing assaults targeting Black and Asian people, the FBI reported Monday.In all, the federal agency tallied 7,759 hate crimes last year, a tumultuous 12 months marked by a global pandemic, a divisive presidential election and upheaval in the economy. The total represented an increase of 6 percent from 2019 and the most since 2008, when 7,783 hate crimes were reported.It is the sixth time in the past seven years that the number of attacks rose. The number of hate crimes reported has increased by nearly 42 percent since 2014, according to federal data.Attacks targeting Black people  rose from 1,930 to 2,755, and the number targeting Asian people jumped from 158 to 274, the data showed. Those figures come as civil rights groups have warned of increasing hostility toward minorities amid a rise in white nationalism and an increase in violent crime nationwide.Attacks targeting White people  rose to 773, an increase of about 16 percent.“These hate crimes and other bias-related incidents instill fear across entire communities and undermine the principles upon which our democracy stands,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. He pointed to steps the Justice Department has taken to improve incident reporting and bolster law enforcement training.‘The pain I feel daily’: Parents of slain Army lieutenant urge Md. to change hate-crimes lawCongress mandates that the FBI collect hate-crime data annually based on reports from local law enforcement agencies. In 2020, the number of agencies that participated in that effort fell for at least the second consecutive year — to 15,136, which is 422 fewer than in 2019. Of agencies that did participate, most reported no hate crimes.Congressional Democrats and civil rights advocates have criticized what they describe as a large undercount in the number of hate crimes and other bias incidents, saying local police are poorly trained in how to identify and catalogue hate crimes and lack sufficient resources or interest in investigating them.“While the numbers in this report are shocking, we know that they are not even close to the complete picture,” said Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.Chu cited “increasingly racist and xenophobic rhetoric from political leaders” as contributing to the increase in hate crimes and said the FBI’s report “must be a wake-up call to all who irresponsibly spread fear and anger in our communities that they are putting lives at risk.”Civil rights advocates have cited President Donald Trump’s use of xenophobic language last year, including blaming China for the novel coronavirus, as contributing to a backlash against Asian people.Stop AAPI Hate, a grass-roots group based in California, reported 6,603 hate incidents against Asian people from March 2020 — the start of the pandemic in the United States — through March of this year. According to that data, which was collected through self-reporting portals online and was not thoroughly vetted, about 65 percent of incidents involved verbal harassment such as name-calling, while 12.6 percent involved physical assault.John Yang, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC, said the FBI statistics were “woefully underreported.” He expressed guarded optimism that increased public attention on anti-Asian hate incidents, after several brazen attacks were captured on video, would help efforts to improve accounting of hate crimes.Atlanta shooting victim’s biracial sons seek to unite Black, Asian communitiesIn May, Congress approved the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act, which requires the Justice Department to appoint an official to expedite investigations into hate crimes reported to federal authorities. The act also seeks to improve reporting among localities by bolstering online channels and offering resources in more languages to help immigrants.“Although there is not a lot of dollars involved, hopefully some of the programs by the federal government will gain traction,” Yang said.Attacks targeting Jewish people fell from 953 in 2019 to 676 last year, according to the FBI data. The Anti-Defamation League, using a broader definition of hate incidents, tallied 2,024 incidents of assault, harassment and vandalism against Jews in the United States last year, representing a slight drop from 2019 but still the third-highest number on record.The group’s chief executive, Jonathan Greenblatt, called the FBI’s numbers “disturbing on their own,” but he emphasized that the federal data was probably an undercount, given the declining levels of reporting from local jurisdictions.“The fact that so many law enforcement agencies did not participate is inexcusable, and the fact that 64 jurisdictions with populations over 100,000 affirmatively reported zero hate crimes is simply not credible,” Greenblatt said in a statement. “Data drives policy and without","In all, the FBI tallied 7,tern hate crimes last year, the most since 2008.

CNN's Allie Malloy, Jasmine Wright, Daniella Diaz and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.Biden said hate crimes against Asian Americans have been ""skyrocketing"" since the coronavirus pandemic began more than a year ago and that the country cannot be silent in the face of the hate and violence. ""Our silence is complicity. We cannot be complicit. We have to speak out. We have to act,"" Biden said, speaking from Emory University in Atlanta. He said Asian Americans have been ""attacked, blamed, scapegoated and harassed. They've been verbally assaulted, physically assaulted, killed.""Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Atlanta on Friday to meet with Asian American leaders in the wake of the deadly shooting. They had originally planned to travel to Atlanta to tout the benefits of the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 economic relief package that Biden recently signed into law, but the White House scrapped plans for a rally after the shooting. ""The conversation we had today with the (Asian American and Pacific Islander) leaders, and that we're hearing all across the country, is that hate and violence often hide in plain sight. It's often met with silence,"" Biden said. ""That's been true throughout our history, but that has to change because our silence is complicity.""Biden urged Congress to pass the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act, which he has said would expedite the federal government's response to hate crimes that have risen during the pandemic, support state and local governments to improve hate crimes reporting and make information on hate crimes more accessible to Asian American communities.Biden and Harris did not explicitly state that they considered the shootings earlier this week a hate crime. But they noted that whatever the motivation of the shooter, the killings come amid rising hate crimes against Asian Americans in the United States. ""Racism is real in America and it has always been. Xenophobia is real in America and always has been -- sexism too,"" said Harris, who is America's first Black and South Asian vice president.The vice president said: ""For the last year, we've had people in positions of incredible power scapegoating Asian Americans -- people with the biggest pulpits spreading this kind of hate. Ultimately this is about who we are as a nation. This is about how we treat people with dignity and respect.""'Very somber' meeting with AAPI leadersDuring a meeting with leaders of the Asian American Pacific Islander -- sometimes shortened to AAPI -- community, Biden echoed Harris in condemning the rhetoric from powerful political leaders, according to one attendee. Stephanie Cho, the executive director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said former President Donald Trump's name came up repeatedly during Biden's hourlong meeting with the group.Biden acknowledged Trump's contributions to a rise in hate against Asian Americans, Cho told CNN's Jeff Zeleny. As for what Cho hopes to see from the administration, she said: ""I'd like to see it be beyond this moment. And that as much as the former President called it the 'China virus' and scapegoated Asian Americans and really fueled this racism around Asian Americans, I would like to see the Biden administration come out just as strongly but in support of Asian Americans.""Biden said he would work as ""much as possible"" to roll back that rhetoric.""He definitely said that they were definitely harmful,"" Cho said of when the topic of Trump's statements came up in the meeting.""And it's his position and his administration to completely roll back all of that,"" Cho added.Cho described the meeting as ""very somber"" but said that Biden was ""trying to understand"" the issue and to hear directly from AAPI leaders.Biden would not describe the shootings as a hate crime yet, and Cho said she understood why he has to take that position, although she feels differently.Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois sent two letters to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray this week asking for a review of hate crimes against Asian Americans, as she lobbies the Biden administration to prioritize the issue. She asked for them to review why some hate crimes against the AAPI community are not reported as such. Duckworth also called Harris this week, a source familiar with the call told CNN. The source declined to provide details of the pair's conversation, but added broadly, ""The administration is keeping an open line out to everyone. We want to keep talking and figure out ways to engage with the AAPI community.""

CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report. The individual ""was arrested and charged with Felony Assault as a Hate Crime,"" the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force said in a tweet. Police previously said the woman was punched and kicked by an attacker who allegedly made anti-Asian statements toward her.The incident -- which comes at a time when New York City and the nation has seen an increase in reports of attacks against Asian people -- was captured on surveillance video and released by the NYPD, which also released photos of an unidentified male.In an earlier press release, police said an individual ""proceeded to kick the victim multiple times in the head before fleeing the location,"" which can be seen on the surveillance footage. The NYPD told CNN the attacker allegedly yelled an expletive followed by ""you don't belong here!""  The victim, according to police, sustained a serious physical injury and was taken by paramedics to NYU Langone Hospital in stable condition.  Police Commissioner Dermot Shea, speaking on CNN affiliate NY1 on Tuesday, called this most recent attack ""very disturbing.""""It's really disgusting when you see the video,"" he said. ""We're calling on all New Yorkers, anyone with information, we put out a pretty good picture of the, the individual that we want to talk to that was seen walking away, and you just try to make sense of it...and you can't,"" he said.Police say the incident happened in front of 360 West 43rd St., which is the address of an apartment complex owned by the Brodsky Organization.The video, which seems to be from the vantage point of a camera inside the apartment complex, appears to show onlookers not reacting to the attack. The Brodsky Organization issued a statement saying in part that ""the staff who witnessed the attack have been suspended pending an investigation in conjunction with their union.""It also said it was ""also working to identify a third-party delivery vendor present during the incident so that appropriate action can be taken.""The organization ""condemns all forms of discrimination, racism, xenophobia and violence against the Asian American community,"" it said in the statement.The NYPD recently announced an initiative to put Asian officers undercover to help combat the recent spate of hate crimes against Asians. Shea said they began deploying Friday night.""We're putting heavy, heavy uniform presence as well,"" amid predominantly Asian communities in the city and through the transit system as well.CNN has asked NYPD if the surveillance footage was from inside the apartment complex and provided by the organization and has not yet received an answer. Mayor calls attack disgusting and outrageousNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the brazen attack against the woman ""disgusting"" and ""outrageous"" and called on anyone with information about the incident to reach out to the police.""We continue to see these horrible disgusting attacks on Asian American New Yorkers and it's got to end and we're going to use every tool we have,"" he said during his daily briefing Tuesday.De Blasio said that while the city is ""not where we need to be"" in terms of combating hate toward Asians he is confident ""a lot of the right tools are there.""He was pressed on whether the city was doing enough.""I'm very frustrated by these attacks, it's horrible, it's disgusting to see,"" he said adding ""it's so unfair to Asian New Yorkers.""New York ""has seen this before"" in terms of hatred toward other groups, including Muslims and LGBTQIA community, De Blasio said.""We know some of the things that work,"" he said, including solidarity, getting supporters involved, and assisting the NYPD.He said Asian American New Yorkers who are feeling isolated and fearful ""need to know that they have solidarity of all New Yorkers, and support.""Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he has directed the New York State Police Hate Crimes Task Force to assist the NYPD in the investigation.""Violence against our Asian American community is unfortunately becoming an epidemic in our state and across this nation, and it must stop now,"" Cuomo said.

Josh Hawley.The bill would also direct the departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to issue guidance raising awareness of hate crimes during the pandemic, and work with agencies to establish online reporting of them.  It now goes to the House before being signed into law by President Joe Biden.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday that the bill is ""proof"" that ""the Senate can work to solve important issues,"" and would tell bigots ""we're going after you.""The bill, sponsored by New York Democratic Rep. Grace Meng and Hawaii Democratic Sen.

Susan Collins and others teamed up with Hirono to strike an agreement broadening its support. Hirono said Thursday that the bill's passage ""sends a clear and unmistakable message of solidarity"" to the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. Collins said it ""affirms our commitment to stand with"" them against hate crimes.In a tweet Thursday evening, Hawley explained that his opposition stemmed from what he called ""big free speech questions"" raised by the legislation. ""My big problem with Sen Hirono's bill that Senate voted on today is that it turns the federal government into the speech police - gives government sweeping authority to decide what counts as offensive speech and then monitor it,"" he said. Hirono and other Democrats have also pressured Biden to include more Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in top roles. Biden has since named Erika Moritsugu, a former official at the National Partnership for Women & Families and counsel to Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, as a liaison to the AAPI community.Of the 23 Cabinet-level positions requiring Senate consideration, Biden nominated two Asian Americans: Katherine Tai for trade representative and Neera Tanden for Office of Management and Budget director.

The man was approached from behind on an East Harlem corner about 8:20 p.m., struck in the back and, after falling to the ground, kicked in the head multiple times, according to the NYPD. The victim's name was not released. The attack comes amid a surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans that prompted the NYPD to deploy undercover Asian officers on the streets in an attempt to stem the violence. The attacker got away, police said. The victim was transported with significant injuries to a hospital in Harlem. New York Police Commissioner Dermot Shea on Saturday tweeted a video of the assault and photo of the suspect. The NYPD said it's investigating more than 60 possible hate crimes against Asian Americans this year, and 42 incidents through the end of March have been classified as hate crimes.    The Senate voted 92-6 to advance a bill Wednesday that would assign a Justice Department official to expedite reviews of potential Covid-19-related hate crimes and establish an online database. The shootings of six Asian women in the Atlanta area last month drew attention to a spike in anti-Asian violence across the United States. A survey by the Pew Research Group this week found that 32% of Asian adults fear someone might threaten or physically attack them -- and 81% said violence against them is rising. About 20% of the respondents said former President Donald Trump's ""rhetoric about China as the source of the pandemic"" as well as his racist labeling of the coronavirus as the ""kung flu"" or ""Chinese flu"" has contributed to the mounting violence, according to the survey.  A report by Stop AAPI Hate cited nearly 3,800 ""hate incidents"" against Asian Americans from March to February, ranging from verbal harassment to assaults to workplace discrimination.

""Today I can say that because of all of you ... you've taken that first step.""  In a sign of progress toward more normalcy since the start of the pandemic, Thursday's bill signing marked the first time a large group publicly gathered inside the White House unmasked since the start of the Biden administration. Vice President Kamala Harris, the first South Asian to serve in her role, said acts of hate are ""nothing new"" and part of her ""lived experience,"" telling the audience in the East Room ahead of the signing that the new law brings ""us one step closer to stopping hate, not only for Asian Americans, but for all Americans."" But she added that ""our work will not be done"" following the bill signing, saying, ""Here's the truth: racism exists in America, xenophobia exists in America, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia-- it all exists. And so, the work to address injustice wherever it exists, remains the work ahead.""The legislation, called the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act, will create a new position at the Justice Department to expedite review of potential Covid-19-related hate crimes and incidents reported at the federal, state or local level. It will also direct the Justice Department and Health and Human Services to work with community-based organizations to issue guidance raising awareness of hate crimes during the pandemic, and would require the attorney general to issue guidance to work with state and local law enforcement agencies to establish online reporting of them.Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that the signing marks an ""important step toward protecting everyone in our country from acts of hate and intolerance."" ""This new law will help speed our response to hate crimes and provide resources to law enforcement to improve hate crime reporting,"" Garland said.

He was removed to Bellevue Hospital for evaluation, and the drug K2 was allegedly recovered, police said.K2, also known as ""spice,"" is a mixture of herbs, spices or shredded plant material that has been sprayed with chemicals that are similar to THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.CNN has reached out to the District Attorney to ask what charges will ultimately be filed. CNN is working to identify an attorney for the accused. A video of the incident, tweeted by New York Assemb. Yuh-Line Niou and confirmed as accurate by NYPD Lt.

In a letter sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland, Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Rep. Grace Meng of New York highlighted provisions of the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act that are ""critical to its effectiveness"" and said the agency should pay attention to them. ""Full implementation of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act will help stem the tide against further violence,"" they said in the letter on Monday.The letter comes weeks after the FBI released its annual hate crime statistics report showing that more than 10,000 people reported to law enforcement last year that they were the victim of a hate crime because of their race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, religion or disability. The Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act was signed into law in May.  The legislation, sponsored by Hirono and Meng, directed the Justice Department to expedite the review of potential Covid-19-related hate crimes and incidents reported at the federal, state or local level. The bill also directs the Justice Department and Health and Human Services to work with community-based organizations to issue guidance raising awareness of hate crimes during the pandemic, and requires the attorney general to issue guidance for state and local law enforcement agencies on how to establish an online reporting system. Hirono and Meng highlighted those provisions in their letter.A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed receiving the letter but did not provide further comment.Garland previously announced a series of steps intended to help the Justice Department implement the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act, including assigning a deputy associate attorney general to coordinate anti-hate crime resources.He appointed Rachel Rossi, a deputy associate attorney general, as the agency's hate crimes coordinator, and designed the criminal section chief in the civil rights division to facilitate an expedited review of hate incidents in accordance with the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act.This fall, the department is expected to distribute several grants to state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies ""to conduct outreach, education, investigations and the prosecution of hate crimes,"" the agency had said in a news release.While Hirono and Meng praised Garland's efforts, the lawmakers said they are worried that ""hate-based violence"" will continue as Covid-19 variants lead to restrictions and ""frustration with the virus will undoubtedly resurface.""Last month, Asian American leaders raised similar concerns in anticipation of the release of a report on the origins of the Covid-19 virus.While the ""dangerous rhetoric"" and anti-Asian remarks from US officials have diminished since Biden took office and the President has showed his support to the AAPI community, leaders said the harsh language against China can still bring hate toward Asian Americans.A recent report by Stop AAPI Hate indicates that more than 9,000 reports of bias have been made since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. The coalition said 4,533 of those incidents took place in the first six months of this year.The organization has previously said it doesn't independently verify any of the reports it receives, but that its total number of incidents only includes those reports that came with a description.The majority of the incidents -- about 63.7% -- were cases of verbal harassment, while shunning or avoidance made up about 16.5%. About 13.7% of the incidents involved physical assaults, according to Stop AAPI Hate.",Sen. Mazie Hirono and Rep.

Prosecutors are also investigating whether the attacks were racially motivated.Another high-profile example includes the January murder of Vichar Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old immigrant from Thailand who was shoved to the ground in San Francisco and never regained consciousness after the fall.San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin has since charged a suspect in Ratanapakdee’s death.",The Justice Department said on Friday it will investigate the rising tide of anti-Asian hate crimes in America.

Long was being held in Cherokee County, where he resided and where the shootings began.Long was headed for Florida when he was apprehended, perhaps to carry out further shootings, authorities said. A 9mm firearm was found in his car.Although officials said Long indicated he may have patronized the establishments where Tuesday’s violence occurred, they could not immediately confirm whether he had actually been a customer of those businesses.And it was not clear whether the suspect may have visited spas for sex.Related Coverage“This is still an ongoing investigation, and at this time we cannot answer any questions pertaining to the businesses, nor services that any of these locations were offering during or before this incident took place,” Officer C.J. Johnson of the Atlanta Police Department said in a statement.U.S. President Joe Biden said he was briefed by the U.S. attorney general and FBI director on the shootings.“The question of motivation is still to be determined,” Biden told reporters at the White House. “But whatever the motivation here I know that Asian Americans are very concerned.”A report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism this month showed that hate crimes against Asian Americans in 16 major U.S. cities rose by 149% from 2019 to 2020, a period when overall hate crimes dropped 7%.Civil rights advocates have said the rise seemed related to Asians and Asian Americans being blamed for the pandemic, which originated in China. Former President Donald Trump called the novel coronavirus the “China virus,” the “China plague” and even the “kung flu.”“It’s very difficult to ignore that the Asian community has once again been targeted, and it’s happening across the country,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN.Nonetheless, authorities said nothing that Long told them in interviews indicated he was motivated by racial animosity, though they stressed the investigation was in its early stages.The bloodshed began Tuesday evening when four people were killed and another was wounded at Young’s Asian Massage in Cherokee County, Baker said. Two Asian women were among the dead there, along with a white woman and a white man, Baker said. The surviving victim was a Hispanic man.In Atlanta, police officers responding to a robbery report an hour later arrived at the Gold Spa beauty salon to find three women shot dead, Police Chief Rodney Bryant told reporters.The officers were then called to a separate spa across the street where another woman was found fatally shot, Bryant said. All four women killed in Atlanta were Asian.South Korea on Wednesday said its consulate-general in Atlanta confirmed that the dead included four women of Korean descent but was verifying their nationalities.Long was spotted driving later in southern Georgia, far from the crime scenes, and was arrested without incident after a highway pursuit, authorities said.His first court appearance was set for Thursday, then postponed without explanation.Long’s quick apprehension was aided by his family’s cooperation with investigators and by video footage from security cameras at the crime scenes, police said.Little about Long’s personal life emerged the day after the shootings; he graduated from an Atlanta-area high school in 2017 and attended a nearby Baptist church.An inactive Instagram account that appeared to have been his bore the tagline: “Pizza, guns, drums, music, family, and God. This pretty much sums up my life,” according to The Daily Beast.The killings marked the latest in a string of deadly mass shootings at schools, movie theaters, medical clinics and other public places in the United States in recent years.Long purchased the gun found in his car legally at Big Woods Goods in Holly Springs, Georgia, CNN reported, citing an attorney for the company.Gun control is a divisive issue in the ","The suspect, Robert Aaron Long, 21, told investigators that a sex addiction drove him to commit Tuesday's killings.

Reuters,Asian hate crimes,3,"Biden deplores rising anti-Asian violence, asks Americans to stand together against hate",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2BB0ZY,"President Joe Biden deplored a surge in anti-Asian violence in the United States after a deadly shooting rampage in Georgia, and asked all Americans to stand together against hate during a visit to the state on Friday.Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris met for more than an hour with leaders and state lawmakers from the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community, which has been rattled by this week’s murders of eight people, including six women of Asian descent, after a year of rising anti-Asian violence.“Hate can have no safe harbor in America. It must stop. And it is on all of us, all of us together, to make it stop,” Biden said after the meeting, calling on U.S. lawmakers to pass a COVID-19 hate crimes bill that would expand Justice Department review of hate crimes exacerbated by the pandemic.Harris, the first Asian-American vice president in U.S. history, tied the violence to the long history of racism in the United States and likened it to the targeting of Muslims after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.“Racism is real in America, and it has always been. Xenophobia is real in America, and always has been. Sexism, too,” Harris said. “The president and I will not be silent. We will not stand by. We will always speak out against violence, hate crimes and discrimination wherever and whenever it occurs.”A 21-year-old man has been charged with Tuesday’s murders at three spas in and around Atlanta. Investigators said the suspect, who is white, suggested that sexual frustration led him to commit violence. But political leaders and civil rights advocates have speculated the killings were motivated at least in part by anti-Asian sentiment.Advocates say the surge of attacks on Asian Americans is largely the result of the community being targeted over the coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.On Friday, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the violence was exacerbated by language used by former President Donald Trump, who repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the “China virus” and the “kung flu.”Biden ordered the U.S. flag flown at half-staff at the White House to honor the victims of the Atlanta area shootings.The meeting with Asian-American community leaders was a shift in focus of a trip originally planned to promote the newly enacted $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.Asian-American voters constitute one of the fastest growing racial and ethnic groups in the country and turned out in record numbers in presidential battleground states in the 2020 election, according to data from TargetSmart, a Democratic political data firm.In Georgia, Asian-American and Pacific Islander voters exceeded their total 2016 turnout by 58%, the firm said. These voters were key to carrying Biden to success in states where the race was close such as Georgia, the firm said.As he headed to Georgia, Biden stumbled as he climbed aboard Air Force One. White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters he was “doing 100 percent fine” and suggested high winds at Joint Base Andrews near Washington may have been a factor.The Democratic president’s trip was initially part of the “Help is Here” campaign, which he kicked off on Monday to promote his promise of “shots in arms and money in pockets,” after signing the COVID-19 relief bill into law last week. Biden has traveled to Pennsylvania and Harris has been to Nevada and Colorado to tout the benefits of the package.Before they met with Asian-American leaders, Biden and Harris received a coronavirus update at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention where they thanked health officials for their effort fighting the pandemic.“This is a war and you are the frontline troops,” Biden said. “We owe you a debt of gratitude for all the lives you’ve saved.”In his remarks after meeting with community leaders, Biden touted the COVID-19 relief bill’s benefits for Georgia, saying the state’s schools will get $4 billion and state government $5 billion.“That’s going to make it possible to keep a lot of police officers, firefighters, teachers and other first responders on the job,” he said.Harris and Biden also met with Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia gubernatorial candidate whose get-out-the vote efforts are widely credited with helping Biden carry the state last November and their fellow Democrats win two runoffs in Georgia that gave them control of the U.S. Senate.“If anyone ever wondered if voting can change a country, Georgia just proved it can,” he said. But he warned the battle for voting rights was not over.A bill passed by the Republican-controlled Georgia House of Representatives this month would restrict ballot drop boxes, tighten absentee voting requirements and limit early voting on Sundays, curtailing traditional “Souls to the Polls” voter turnout programs in Black churches.Biden and Harris also met U.S. Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff and Democratic Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.They discussed the Georgia legislat",Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris met for more than an hour with Asian-American community leaders from the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community,Pretending to care,Should go to campus of Harvard university.

Elliot, who was on lifetime parole after serving a prison term for murdering his mother, was arrested without incident at his residence in New York City on Tuesday, police said.The New York Times identified the victim of the attack as Vilma Kari, an immigrant from the Philippines, citing a law enforcement source. An NYPD spokesman declined to confirm her identity. According to the Times, Kari suffered a fractured pelvis.“We want to extend our sincere well wishes and speedy recovery to the elderly lady for this unnecessary assault,” Wellington Chen, executive director of New York City’s Chinatown Partnership, said on Wednesday. “Hope this arrest gives her and her family a bit of relief.”There has been an increase in hate crimes reported against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Former President Donald Trump often referred to the coronavirus as the “China virus” and the “China plague.”Such crimes rose by 149% in 2020 in 16 major cities compared with 2019, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.Concern over anti-Asian hate crimes was heightened when six Asian women were among eight people fatally shot this month at Atlanta-area spas. A 21-year-old man was charged with the murders. Police have yet to determine a motive.President Joe Biden’s administration on Tuesday announced a set of measures responding to anti-Asian violence in the United States, including deploying $49.5 million from COVID-19 relief funds for U.S. community programs that help victims.In Monday’s attack in New York, a security video showed witnesses inside the lobby of a building apparently watching the assault but making no effort to help the woman. One man closed the front door while the attacker walked away.The Brodsky Organization, which owns and operates the building, said it has suspended two employees while it and an employees’ union investigate their response to the attack.“We take this situation very seriously, and are committed to strengthening internal training, and working with our community to ensure the safety of our residents and neighbors,” the Brodsky Organization said in a statement.“Had the men watching stepped in, I believe it would’ve helped the woman a lot,” New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. “We need to be the ones leading and doing something to help, not standing by or closing the door on someone.”New York police also are investigating an assault last week on a subway train against a young man who appeared to be Asian. The attack was captured on another widely viewed video. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said the man, who was left unconscious after he was pummeled and choked, has yet to report the crime.","Brandon Elliot, 38, was arrested without incident at his residence in New York City on Tuesday.

NYT,Omicron,1,"Scotland announces 6 cases of Omicron, and Britain considers widening its booster program.",https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/28/world/europe/britain-omicron-response.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur,"Scotland reported six cases of the new Omicron variant on Monday, and contact tracing is underway, said Humza Yousaf, the Scottish health secretary.“We have already taken steps and are aligning with border restrictions being introduced by the U.K. government which will require fully vaccinated arrivals to take a P.C.R. test within two days of arrival” and self-quarantine until a negative test comes back, he said in a statement. He added that it would also be “adopting the expanded red list of countries identified by the U.K. government.”The news came as a member of Britain’s vaccine health advisory panel said it was looking at widening the country’s booster program, and after British health officials on Sunday reported a third case of Omicron in an individual who had spent time in central London. Britain’s new travel rules for international arrivals, as well as mask regulations in shops and on public transportation in England, are expected to go into effect on Tuesday. Despite the new measures, the British health secretary, Sajid Javid, rejected calls for tougher restrictions on daily life on Sunday.The government has stopped short of ordering people to work from home where possible, introducing vaccine passports in England or requiring masks in restaurants. “This is about taking proportionate action against the risks we face,” Mr. Javid told the BBC on Sunday, speaking before the third case was confirmed.The health security agency said the third case involved an individual who had spent time in the Westminster section of London, but who was no longer in the country, and that contact tracing was being performed. It said the case was linked to travel in southern Africa.Dr. Jenny Harries, chief executive of the agency, said it was “very likely” that there would be more cases in the coming days.Britain began suspending flights from six southern African nations on Friday, but some travelers had already arrived in London by the time the measure took effect.Mr. Javid acknowledged that passengers landing on Friday were not tested at the airport and were able to leave as usual, including by public transport.

There is an economic and human cost.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Motoko Rich and Hikari HidaTOKYO — With the emergence of the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus late last week, countries across the globe rushed to close their borders to travelers from southern Africa, even in the absence of scientific information about whether such measures were necessary or likely to be effective in stopping the virus’s spread.Japan has gone further than most other countries so far, announcing on Monday that the world’s third-largest economy would be closed off to travelers from everywhere.It is a familiar tactic for Japan. The country has barred tourists since early in the pandemic, even as most of the rest of the world started to travel again. And it had only tentatively opened this month to business travelers and students, despite recording the highest vaccination rate among the world’s large wealthy democracies and after seeing its coronavirus caseloads plunge by 99 percent since August.Now, as the doors slam shut again, Japan provides a sobering case study of the human and economic cost of those closed borders. Over the many months that Japan has been isolated, thousands of life plans have been suspended, leaving couples, students, academic researchers and workers in limbo.Ayano Hirose has not been able to see her fiancé in person for the past 19 months, since he left Japan for his native Indonesia, just two weeks after her parents blessed their marriage plans.As Japan has remained closed to most outsiders, Ms. Hirose and her fiancé, Dery Nanda Prayoga, saw no clear path to a reunion. Indonesia had started allowing some visitors, but the logistical challenges were steep. So the couple has made do with multiple daily video calls. When they run out of things to talk about, they play billiards on Facebook Messenger or watch Japanese variety shows together online.“We don’t want to suffer in pain at the thought of not being able to reunite in the near future,” said Ms. Hirose, 21, who has written letters to the foreign and justice ministries asking for an exemption to allow Mr. Dery to come to Japan. “So we will think positively and continue to hold out hope.”As the United States, Britain and most of Europe reopened over the summer and autumn to vaccinated travelers, Japan and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region opened their borders only a crack, even after achieving some of the world’s highest vaccination rates. Now, with the emergence of the Omicron variant, Japan, along with Australia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Indonesia and South Korea, is quickly battening down again.China, which has barred international tourists since the start of the pandemic, is so far still issuing visas for work or diplomatic purposes, although limited flight options and lengthy quarantines have deterred travelers. Taiwan has prohibited nearly all nonresidents from entering since early in the pandemic. Australia, which only recently started allowing citizens and visa holders to travel abroad, said on Monday that it would delay a relaxation of its border restrictions. Sri Lanka, Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand have all barred travelers from southern Africa, where the variant was first reported.Although the true threat of the new variant is not yet clear, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan told reporters on Monday that he had decided to revoke the relaxations for business travelers and international students in order to “avoid the worst-case scenario.”The government’s decision to close again reflects its desire to preserve its successes battling the virus and to prevent the kind of strain on the health care system that it experienced over the summer during an outbreak of the Delta variant.Japan is recording only about 150 coronavirus cases a day, and before the emergence of the Omicron variant, business leaders had been calling for a more aggressive reopening.“At the beginning of the pandemic, Japan did what most countries around the world did — we thought we needed proper border controls,” Yoshihisa Masaki, director of communications at Keidanren, Japan’s largest business lobbying group, said in an interview earlier this month.But as cases diminished, he said, the continuation of firm border restrictions threatened to stymie economic progress. “It will be like Japan being left behind in the Edo Period,” Mr. Masaki said, referring to Japan’s isolationist era between the 17th and mid-19th centuries.Japan had already lagged countries in Southeast Asia, where the economies are dependent on tourism revenues and governments tiptoed out in front in the push to reopen. Thailand had recently reopened to tourists from 63 countries, and Cambodia had just started to welcome vaccinated visitors with minimal restrictions.

Benfica’s players will be tested for the virus, the country’s general health director, Graça Freitas, told the local TSF radio station.Later in the day, Spain announced its first case of the Omicron variant, contracted by a person who traveled over the weekend from South Africa. The patient, a 51-year-old man, has been quarantined at the Gregorio Marañón hospital in Madrid since Sunday following a trip from South Africa with a stopover in Amsterdam, according to the regional government in the capital. Officials said in statement that the man is showing only mild symptoms of the illness.Before the game on Saturday, as many as 17 players and staff members of the Belenenses club tested positive for the virus, although it was unclear at the time whether those cases involved the new variant. The Belenenses players sought to have the game canceled, but officials reportedly told them that it had to go on.Separately, Portugal’s health authorities said they were tracing more than 200 passengers who had arrived in Portugal on Saturday from Maputo, Mozambique. At least two people on the flight had tested positive for the virus, but the authorities said it was too early to confirm whether these were Omicron cases.Portugal on Monday began suspending all flights to and from Mozambique, which is a former Portuguese colony and shares a border with South Africa, over concerns about the new variant.",Portuguese national health institute confirms 13 cases of Omicron variant of coronavirus.

But while we have that travel restrictions can slow the speed of Omicron, it cannot prevent it. But here’s what it does. It gives us time, gives us time to take more actions, to move quicker, to make sure people understand you have to get your vaccine. You have to get the shot. You have to get the booster. The — sooner or later, we’re going to see cases of this new variant here in the United States. We’ll have to face this new threat just as we faced those that come before it. This variant is a cause for concern, not a cause for panic. We have the best vaccine in the world, the best medicines, the best scientists, and we’re learning more every single day. And we’ll fight this variant with scientific and knowledgeable actions and speed, not chaos and confusion. In the event — hopefully unlikely — that updated vaccinations or boosters are needed to respond to this new variant, we will accelerate their development and deployment with every available tool. I want to reiterate: Dr. Fauci believes that the current vaccines provide at least some protection against the new variant and the boosters strengthen that protection, significantly. We do not yet believe that additional measures will be needed, but so that we are prepared if needed, my team is already working with officials at Pfizer and Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson to develop contingency plans for vaccines or boosters if needed.By Sheryl Gay StolbergPresident Biden sought to reassure the nation on Monday about the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus as crucial questions about it remain, telling Americans that the variant is “a cause for concern, not a cause for panic,” and that his administration was working with vaccine manufacturers to modify vaccines and booster shots should that prove necessary.“We’re throwing everything we have at this virus, tracking it from every angle,” Mr. Biden said at the White House, adding, “I’m sparing no effort, removing all roadblocks to keep the American people safe.”The president is expected to visit the National Institutes of Health on Thursday, and said he would outline “a strategy for how we are going to fight Covid this winter, not with shutdowns or with lockdowns, but with more widespread vaccinations, boosters, testing and more.” The variant has yet to be detected in the United States.Mr. Biden has already restricted travel from eight nations, including South Africa, a move that experts said would buy the United States time in determining how to respond. But it will likely be a week, possibly two weeks, before experts know more about the new variant. It has mutations that scientists fear could make it more infectious and less susceptible to vaccines, though evidence to support those fears has yet to be established.Despite significant questions about the variant itself — including whether it causes mild or severe disease — countries around the world have rushed to defend against its spread, with a cascade of border closures and travel restrictions that recalled the earliest days of the pandemic.Mr. Biden was elected on a promise to bring the pandemic under control — a task that is proving easier said than done. Viruses are dedicated to ensuring their own survival, and that is especially true of the virus that causes Covid-19. Just as Mr. Biden was about to declare “independence from the virus” on the July 4 holiday, the Delta variant swept across the United States, causing another wave of hospitalizations and deaths.Now there is Omicron, discovered in southern Africa and designated by the World Health Organization on Friday as a “variant of concern,” popping up just as the holiday travel season gets underway.Mr. Biden is trying to project calm and keep the country from panicking while also ensuring that Americans get vaccinated and take other precautions, including masking and social distancing. He was joined at the White House by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, who said that current P.C.R. tests were able to detect the new variant.The emergence of the new variant is also increasing pressure on Mr. Biden and his administration to do more to share vaccines with the rest of the world.South Africa, whose scientists detected the variant, has fully vaccinated only 24 percent of its population, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. It has a better vaccination rate than most countries on the continent, but has asked vaccine makers to stop sending doses: It is having trouble getting shots into arms, in part because of distribution bottlenecks and in part because many people are hesitant to take them.The Omicron variant.

NYT,Omicron,5,Omicron was present in Europe days before flights were halted.,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/11/30/world/omicron-variant-covid?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur#omicron-was-present-in-europe-days-earlier-than-originally-thought-dutch-officials-say,"Two people who tested positive for the coronavirus in the Netherlands more than a week ago were infected with the Omicron variant, Dutch health officials reported on Tuesday. The timing is significant because it suggests that the variant was already present in the country for at least a week before the arrival of two flights from South Africa on Friday, and before the World Health Organization labeled Omicron a “variant of concern,” the step that prompted countries around the world to ban flights from southern Africa, where researchers first identified the variant. “We have found the Omicron coronavirus variant in two test samples that were taken on Nov. 19 and Nov. 23,” the Dutch health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. “It is not yet clear whether these people had also visited southern Africa.” The two samples were taken by municipal health services at public testing sites, and health authorities have started contact tracing in those areas, Dutch health officials said. Although little is known yet about how transmissible Omicron is, or whether it can evade existing vaccines, its detection in Botswana and South Africa has created the most uncertain moment of the pandemic since the highly contagious Delta variant emerged in the spring. The announcement from the Netherlands also highlighted that scientists still cannot say with certainty where or when the variant originated. So far, the first known sample of the Omicron variant was collected on Nov. 9 in South Africa, according to Gisaid, an international database for disease variants. Officials across Europe fear that Omicron will add pressure on countries that are already in the grip of some of the worst coronavirus surges they have seen. Among them was France, which on Tuesday reported about 47,000 new cases over the past 24 hours and sharply rising hospitalizations — mostly thought to be driven by the Delta variant. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control said on Tuesday that so far, 44 cases of the new variant have been confirmed in 11 European countries. And in Britain, health officials announced at least 22 confirmed cases involving Omicron, including 13 in England and 9 in Scotland, bringing a new wave of tightened public health restrictions. Andrea Ammon, the agency’s director, told an online news conference that all the confirmed cases in Europe have exhibited mild symptoms or none at all, and that authorities were analyzing six further “probable” cases. She said that health officials were conducting additional tests on people who have recovered from illness brought on by Omicron to help assess how the variant behaves in vaccinated people, and that more information was expected in a “couple of weeks.” Countries across the European Union have scrambled to reinforce travel restrictions in the hope of curbing the spread of the heavily mutated variant, as the W.H.O. warned that the risk it posed was “very high.” But the W.H.O.’s top official on Tuesday cautioned countries that their responses were “not evidence-based.” “We still have more questions than answers about the effect of Omicron on transmission, severity of disease, and the effectiveness of tests, therapeutics and vaccines,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva. The Dutch officials’ announcement about the two Omicron cases came after a chaotic series of closures in Amsterdam, which left some 600 passengers on two flights from South Africa stranded for a time on Friday. Some 61 passengers on those flights tested positive for the coronavirus, and at least 14 of them were found to be carrying the Omicron variant. The Netherlands imposed tighter restrictions starting on Sunday in response to a Covid wave that began before Omicron was identified, ordering many businesses, including bars, restaurants and theaters, to close from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. Dutch health officials reported more than 22,000 new coronavirus cases on Monday, one of the country’s highest daily totals since the pandemic began.",Two people tested positive for the Omicron coronavirus in the Netherlands more than a week ago.

But studies using the variant’s full sequences have not been completed, it said.The company said it had already been testing future antibody drug candidates, and that preliminary analyses indicated that some of those “may have the potential to retain activity against the Omicron variant.” More data is expected in the coming month, it said.“What we have to admit is, in the course of the past six days, our urgency has increased,” Dr. George Yancopoulos, Regeneron’s president and chief scientific officer, told The Wall Street Journal in an interview. “What started out as a backup plan has now been made a lot more urgent.”An updated list of potential treatments for Covid-19.The Omicron variant has caused alarm among scientists because it contains mutations in the spike protein, the target of the government-supplied monoclonal antibody treatments made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly.Scientists have also been scrambling to gather data on how effective the current vaccines will be against Omicron.

Anyone can read what you share.By Jason HorowitzROME — In a wrenchingly familiar cycle of tracking first cases, pointing fingers and banning travel, nations worldwide reacted Monday to the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in the piecemeal fashion that has defined — and hobbled — the pandemic response all along.As here-we-go-again fear and resignation gripped much of the world, the World Health Organization warned that the risk posed by the heavily mutated variant was “very high.” But operating once again in a vacuum of evidence, governments chose approaches that differed between continents, between neighboring countries, and even between cities within those countries.Little is known about Omicron beyond its large number of mutations; it will be weeks, at least, before scientists can say with confidence whether it is more contagious — early evidence suggests it is — whether it causes more serious illness, and how it responds to vaccines.In China, which had been increasingly alone in sealing itself off as it sought to eradicate the virus, a newspaper controlled by the Communist Party gloated about democracies that are now following suit as Japan, Australia and other countries gave up flirting with a return to normalcy and slammed their borders shut to the world. The West, it said, had hoarded vaccines at the expense of poorer regions, and was now paying a price for its selfishness.In the United States, federal officials called Monday on vaccinated people to get booster shots. President Biden sought to reassure Americans, saying that the new variant is “a cause for concern, not a cause for panic” and that his administration was already working with vaccine manufacturers to modify vaccines, should that prove necessary.“We’re throwing everything we have at this virus, tracking it from every angle,” the president said in an appearance at the White House.In southern Africa, where scientists first identified Omicron amid a largely unvaccinated population, leaders deplored the travel bans as ruinous and counterproductive to tracking the virus, saying they could discourage transparency about outbreaks. African officials also noted that because of the inequity in distribution of vaccines, the continent faces this latest variant with little to no protection.But with vaccine deliveries to Africa becoming more reliable, some states looked to a vaccine mandate to curb the spread of the coronavirus. On Sunday, Ghana’s government announced that government employees, health care workers and staff and students at most schools must be vaccinated by Jan. 22.Europe which has acted in unusual concert in barring travel from southern Africa, is speeding up booster shots in the hope that they will work against Omicron, and adjusting or reconsidering a hodgepodge of social-distancing measures, even in restriction-resistant countries such as Britain.“The lack of a consistent and coherent global approach has resulted in a splintered and disjointed response, breeding misunderstanding, misinformation and mistrust,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization director.The W.H.O. convened a three-day special session to discuss a treaty that would ensure prompt sharing of data and technology and equitable access to vaccines. The European Union has pushed for the agreement to be legally binding, but the United States has balked.The very proposal underlined that two years into a devastating pandemic that has killed millions, devastated national economies and robbed many of the world’s children of nearly two years of formative experiences, there is still no global plan for getting out of it.As the largely vaccinated West clings to initial reports that Omicron may cause milder illness and may be susceptible to vaccines, entire swaths of Africa remain essentially unvaccinated. Some nations, like South Africa, have sufficient doses but have struggled to distribute them. Others lack the freezers, logistical infrastructure and medical personnel to inoculate their populations.That has given the virus plenty of time and bodies in which to multiply and mutate.The travel bans are intended to buy time as scientists determine whether the mutations in new variant will allow it to dodge existing vaccines. But they also seemed to suggest that core lessons from the early phase of the pandemic must be learned again: An infection discovered somewhere is likely everywhere — or may be soon enough — and a single case detected means many more undetected.On Monday, Portugal reported 13 Omicron cases — all tied to a single soccer team — and Scotland reported six, while the numbers in South Africa continued to soar.Experts warned that the variant will reach every part of the world, if it hasn’t already.The leaders of the world’","Almost two years into the pandemic, finger-pointing, lack of coordination, sparse information and fear are once again influencing policy.

WP,Omicron,5,Netherlands says omicron variant was within its borders a week before South Africa revealed it existed,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/netherlands-omicron-covid-origin/2021/11/30/edbc63e0-51e0-11ec-83d2-d9dab0e23b7e_story.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_main,"The omicron variant had a foothold in multiple countries in Europe before travel restrictions were imposed, new genetic sequencing data has revealed.Dutch officials said Tuesday that they had detected the variant, with its unusually high number of mutations, in a sample collected on Nov. 19 and another on Nov. 23 — well before Dutch authorities panicked over two flights from South Africa carrying infected passengers.The earliest known cases are still from southern Africa. The first identified samples were collected Nov. 9, from a 34-year-old man and a 23-year-old man in Johannesburg, according to the GISAID global database. On Nov. 11, five samples of the variant were collected in Botswana.Experts caution, though, that omicron could have originated elsewhere. Even countries with world-leading sequencing programs only assess a portion of their cases. Labs in many countries are now combing through samples collected not just in recent days but over the past month.As of Tuesday, cases of the variant had been reported in 20 countries, with 13 of those in Europe, the European Union’s public health body said.Hong Kong, Sweden, Israel, Britain, Italy, Canada, Belgium and the Netherlands all traced their first cases to samples collected before South Africa warned the world late Thursday of a potentially more contagious variant, with mutations of the sort that might evade vaccines.The next day, as the World Health Organization assessed that omicron was a “variant of concern,” two planes carrying about 600 passengers from South Africa landed in the Netherlands with 61 people testing positive for the virus, 14 of whom had the omicron variant.Announcement of new virus variant alarms world as stock markets crash and flights are banned.The E.U., Britain, the United States and others quickly imposed restrictions on travel from southern African countries. South African leaders decried the travel bans as unnecessary — and as punishment for the vigilance of their scientists and the transparency of their public health officials.While sequencing data underscores that travel restrictions came too late to prevent transmission, a spokesperson for the European Commission defended the moves on Tuesday, saying the restrictions may still slow the spread.“A certain number of precautionary measures had to be taken — not to stop the variant from reaching Europe or other parts of the world — I think everybody recognizes that is not possible,” spokesman Eric Mamer said. “But to ensure that we slow down its spread as much as possible, in order to give European health authorities [and] our pharmaceutical suppliers of vaccines the time to adapt and ensure that we can then roll out an appropriate response.”The E.U. health authority said Tuesday that no severe cases or deaths had been reported in connection to the variant — and that the cases  it had information about were mild or asymptomatic.“The majority of confirmed cases have a history of travel to African countries, with some having taken connecting flights at other destinations between Africa and Europe,” the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control added in a statement.The Dutch public health institute said it did not know if the two first people to test positive there had been in southern Africa.South Africa, which found the omicron variant first, sequences less than 1 percent of coronavirus samplesEurope had been experiencing a surge of coronavirus infections before the omicron variant was detected, and countries have continued to enact measures to mitigate a second pandemic winter.Switzerland said Monday that anyone  — vaccinated or unvaccinated — coming from the growing list of countries where the variant has been detected must quarantine for 10 days on arrival.  Polish media reported that Poland had enacted similar measures.And in Greece, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Tuesday that his country will make vaccination against the coronavirus mandatory for everyone  over  age  60 and will apply 100 euro monthly fines for noncompliance. That money, he said, will be used to support the hospital system.“It is not a punishment,” Mitsotakis said. “I would say it is the price for health.”The executive director of the European Medicines Agency told lawmakers Monday that it could take two weeks to learn whether current vaccines are effective against the omicron variant.If omicron does require a new vaccine formula, Emer Cooke said, approval for use in the E.U. could take up to four months.“We are prepared,” Cooke told E.U. lawmakers. “We know that at some stage there will be a mutation that means we have to change the current approach.” Chico Harlan in Rome and Quentin Aries in Brussels contributed.",New genetic sequencing data reveals omicron variant in omicron variant.

WP,Omicron,6,White House aides search for available contingency funding as they monitor omicron risks,https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/11/30/white-house-omicron-covid-economy/?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_source=twitter,"White House officials have in the past few days studied how much funding they have available to respond to the omicron variant, as the Biden administration makes contingency plans to deal with the next potential stage in the pandemic, three people familiar with the matter said.The review comes amid fresh tremors on Wall Street related to omicron and the economy’s outlook. The CEO of Moderna alarmed investors Tuesday when he warned that vaccines might not be as effective against this particular variant. Several hours later, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell spooked financial markets even more when he said the central bank could speed up the relaxation of its emergency measures amid concerns about inflation.Existing vaccines might not be effective against omicron variant right away, Moderna CEO saysThe burst of uncertainty comes as government officials try to ascertain both the health and economic risks posed by omicron, a new variant of the coronavirus that was recently detected in southern Africa but is now in multiple countries. The White House Office of Management and Budget and senior Biden administration health officials are working to determine exactly how much remaining funding they have that could be redirected to new problems arising from the variant.Congress and the White House approved trillions of dollars in emergency funds starting last year to combat the virus’s spread and try to minimize any economic fallout. Officials are working to determine which accounts still have unused funds that could be diverted if omicron creates new challenges.Stock markets have fluctuated wildly on confusion about whether omicron will prove as risky and deadly as the delta variant did several months ago. Many parts of the economy are already in flux, with consumer confidence trending weaker, inflation trending higher, but the labor market and growth snapping back into stronger positions. There have been signs in recent days that supply chain logjams are loosening, but a fresh round of covid concerns could close some factories and create new delays, driving up the costs of goods and worsening inflation.Powell said that because of already high inflation “it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases … perhaps a few months sooner.” The Fed had extended tremendous economic support to financial markets to keep the economy growing, but he effectively signaled Tuesday that this support could be pulled back faster than earlier estimates. This change in tone led the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 to shed nearly 2 percent by the end of the day.Powell said the Fed would continue to monitor omicron as well as inflation and employment as it decides on the path forward.Over at the White House, officials were working to understand their options but so far do not believe there is a need for an imminent request to Congress for more money. But that could change in coming days, the officials said, as much of the funding already approved for the White House to respond to the pandemic has been earmarked for specific purposes, such as free testing for uninsured Americans. White House officials are looking at how much money they would need in a worst-case scenario, in case the administration needs to immediately purchase mass quantities of vaccines designed to immunize specifically against the new variant.The cost of updated vaccines for all Americans could run as high as $7.5 billion, while buying 2 million additional monoclonal antibody treatments could cost $4 billion, according to one senior administration official, who provided rough estimates. Another $5 billion for 10 million antiviral pills could bring the total to $16 billion, the administration official said. The administration official and two other people familiar with internal discussions spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private deliberations.It is unclear whether the White House has enough funding flexibility to cover all the new potential sources of need. A spokesman for OMB declined to provide estimates of how much funding OMB believes is available to respond to the variant.Omicron mutations alarm scientists, but new variant first must prove it can outcompete deltaBudget experts say the federal government has billions of dollars in funds approved in prior legislation for pandemic-related measures.

It recommended that governments worldwide enhance their ability to sequence coronavirus variants, report any local cases of omicron to the global health body and speed up their vaccination drives.The newly identified omicron variant has 26 to 32 spike mutations, the WHO brief states, “some of which are concerning” in that they could make it more transmissible and better able to evade the body’s immune defenses.[What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus]“Depending on these characteristics, there could be future surges of COVID-19, which could have severe consequences, depending on a number of factors including where surges may take place,” the report says. “The overall global risk related to [omicron] is assessed as very high.” It added that “evidence for this assessment contains considerable uncertainty” and is subject to change.The WHO recommends several actions that its member states should immediately take. Some are new, such as guidance on the marker that can be used to detect the newest variant. Some are consistent with well-known measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus, such as advice for governments to encourage people to wear masks, keep a safe distance from one another and avoid crowds to limit the spread of the virus.As some governments have shut down borders and others are reinforcing public health rules, officials around the world stressed that the measures are designed to buy time to learn more about how the omicron variant spreads, what symptoms it causes and how it reacts to existing coronavirus vaccines.

With divergent vaccination rates, with the unvaccinated population that’s most at risk being made up of Republicans at three times the rate of Democrats, that gap is poised to grow.If we break down monthly case and death figures by county vote in 2020, we see that Trump counties have been hardest hit by the pandemic on a per-capita basis since last year. If we throw in vaccination rates, we see that it is those same counties that have been slowest to get vaccinated. As of April of this year, the most red and most blue counties in the country began to diverge on vaccination rates. As of writing, data compiled by The Washington Post suggests that the counties that voted most strongly for President Biden are fully vaccinated at a rate 40 percent higher than the rate in the counties that voted most strongly for Trump.South Africa has recorded a sharp increase in covid-19 cases, including among children under 2 years old, a top epidemiologist said Monday, as the country reckons with the consequences of being the first to report the omicron variant of the coronavirus.Health-care providers and officials said they are making preparations to deal with what is effectively a fourth wave of the pandemic in the country",Red America has seen the highest rates of cases and deaths and the lowest rate of vaccinations.

WP,Omicron,1,Boris Johnson announces tougher entry rules after 2 cases of omicron detected in the U.K.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/11/27/omicron-variant-britain/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social,"In a bid to halt the spread of the omicron variant of the coronavirus, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced new measures on Saturday evening, including mandatory self-quarantine for anyone arriving in the United Kingdom starting Tuesday and tougher rules on mask-wearing.The initiatives, including significant entry-rule changes made in response to the new variant, are a sign of how countries are reintroducing rules that many had thought were left behind.Earlier in the day, Britain announced that two cases of the new variant, first identified in South Africa, had been detected in the U.K. The cases are linked and connected with travel to southern Africa.Speaking at an evening news conference at 10 Downing Street, Johnson said that anyone entering the country will be asked to take a PCR test by the end of their second day and that they must self-quarantine until they provide a negative coronavirus test result. He also said that those who do come into contact with someone suspected of testing positive for omicron will have to quarantine for 10 days, regardless of their vaccination status.Face coverings on public transport and in shops will be mandatory in England after they were scrapped in July. They have remained mandatory on public transport and in many indoor spaces in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said the main reason the U.K. is moving quickly is because of the risk that the available vaccines aren’t as effective against this new variant. “The risk here is different to delta,” Whitty said, adding that in that case the concern was how rapidly it spread. With omicron, however, there are “at least strong theoretical reasons for thinking that some degree of vaccine escape is likely,” he said.The prime minister said the new rules, which will be reviewed in three weeks, will help to “buy time” for scientists to better understand the variant.The U.K. also added four new African countries to its travel “red list” on Saturday, meaning that travel from a total of 10 African countries is now restricted: Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Travelers from those countries will be denied entry into the U.K. unless they are British or Irish citizens or residents, in which case they will have to quarantine at a government-approved hotel for 10 days.Downing Street’s announcement Saturday, however, was short on details and left many people shortly traveling to the U.K. unclear about the new rules.British media reported Sunday that the new PCR requirement would go into effect at 4 a.m. Tuesday and that the test had to be taken within two days of arrival.But it was clear that Johnson was placing faith in the current vaccination program as he urged a faster rollout of booster shots. “We don’t yet, exactly, know how effective our vaccines will be against omicron, but we have good reasons for believing they will provide at least some measure of protection,” he said.He was asked at the news conference whether Britons should consider rearranging their plans for Christmas.Johnson said he was “confident” that Christmas would be “considerably better than last Christmas.” Given the severe restrictions on many Britons during Christmas last year, that’s not a particularly high bar.",Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced new measures to stop the spread of omicron variant of the coronavirus.

WP,Omicron,4,"Omicron mutations alarm scientists, but new variant first must prove it can outcompete delta",https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/11/29/how-bad-is-omicron-variant/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter,"When the variant now known as omicron first appeared on a global database of coronavirus genomic sequences, scientists were stunned. This was the weirdest creature they’d seen to date. It had an unruly swarm of mutations. Many were known to be problematic, impeding the ability of antibodies to neutralize the virus. But there had never been a variant with so many of these mutations gathered in a package.Even though scientists recognized some of these mutations, many others were new and utterly enigmatic.“We have seen these mutations in other strains, in twos and threes, and each time they were a little harder to neutralize, but didn’t spread particularly well. Now, all together? It’s a complete black box,” Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University, said in an email.Of the many questions about omicron, the overriding one is whether it’s as bad as it looks at first glance.President Biden on Monday expressed confidence that the United States can handle the new variant.“This variant is a cause for concern, not a cause for panic,” Biden said. “We’ll fight this variant with scientific and knowledgeable actions, and speed, not chaos and confusion.”In a preliminary technical brief, the World Health Organization said the “overall global risk” from omicron is “very high,” and recommended that governments worldwide enhance their ability to sequence coronavirus variants, report local cases of omicron to the global health body and accelerate their vaccination drives.In remarks prepared in advance of congressional testimony Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell warned that the recent rise in coronavirus cases in the United States and the emergence of omicron “pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation.”The significance of omicron pivots on several unknowns. Is it more transmissible than the delta variant? Can it cause more severe illness? And can it erode or even completely evade immunity, whether induced by vaccines or previous infections?Earlier variants, including alpha and delta, had mutated in ways that enhanced their transmissibility. But scientists have long feared the possibility that the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, would evolve to become a more slippery, elusive pathogen — evading, even if only partially, the early lines of defense from the immune system, including neutralizing antibodies.There are other elements of the immune system, such as “killer” T cells, that provide backup protection, and they are likely to provide protection from severe illness even for new variants such as omicron, infectious-disease experts think.Omicron has about 30 mutations scattered on three major prongs of the spike protein that is essential to the virus’s ability to infect cells. Disease-fighting antibodies that can potentially neutralize the invading virus target those spike proteins. The mutations change one amino acid to another in a way that can alter the structure or chemistry of the protein and prevent antibodies from binding as they normally would.Unfortunately, mutations don’t come with handy explanatory labels when they appear in a genomic sequence. And no one can tell how multiple mutations would work as a team — whether they would turn the virus into something even more dangerous than the delta variant or somehow sap omicron’s powers.“Omicron is like the song ‘One Piece at a Time’ by Johnny Cash, where he puts together a car from stolen bits of lots of different cars. It is made of mutations that were somewhat successful separately in other variants, but together it is hard to say more than it looks weird,” Neuman said.Scientists don’t want to get ahead of the facts: No one knows yet how this variant behaves in real-world situations. But if it has a high degree of immune evasiveness, vaccine makers will have to revise their formulas, something already in the works at a preliminary stage. This would be a major setback in the world’s efforts to emerge from a pandemic soon to enter its third full year.The other possibility: Omicron could go the way of alpha, beta, lambda, gamma, mu and other variants that had worrisome mutations and a period of notoriety but were driven virtually to extinction by the more transmissible delta variant.“We’re in a delta pandemic now. Does this outcompete delta? To be determined,” said Robert F. Garry Jr., a virologist at Tulane University who has scrutinized the mutations in omicron. “Delta’s a pretty good virus, right? It’s good in terms of being transmissible. This one would have to show some extraordinary characteristics to outcompete it.”Kristian G. Andersen, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Institute, said in an email, “The only thing I have somewhat moderate confidence in is that I think this’ll be the most immune evasive variant we have seen to date. Other than that, it’s simply too early to tell — on a scale of 1-10 of how bad this is, it’s either a 3, a 10, or anywhere in-between.”Laboratory experiments ca",President Biden expressed confidence that the U.S. can handle the new variant of omicron.

The ban applies to all countries, not just ones with confirmed cases of the omicron variant. Japanese citizens and foreign residents are exempt.The decision makes Japan one of the first countries, and by far the largest, to enact widespread border closures in response to  the newest variant, alongside Israel and Morocco.Japan and South Korea never did full lockdowns. It left lessons on how to coexist with the virus.“This is a preventive, emergency measure to avoid a worst-case scenario,” Kishida said. “This is an extraordinary measure for the time being just until we know more about the omicron variant.”Japan has been closed to tourists for most of the coronavirus pandemic, including for this year’s Olympics. About 370,000 foreigners approved to newly enter Japan before the pandemic have not been able to do so, including about 150,000 international students, according to Nikkei Asia news.With nearly 80 percent of the population fully vaccinated and positive case numbers plummeting, Japan partially reopened on Nov. 8 to allow new arrivals of students and technical interns.Monday’s announcement effectively reverses that decision.On Nov. 26, Japan raised its cap on approved travelers. On Monday, Japan lowered that cap again to 3,500 from 5,000 a day.Japan recorded just 73 positive cases — the lowest in 17 months — and no deaths on Sunday. Tokyo reported eight cases on Monday, out of about 3,700 tests conducted in the capital.The country’s Nikkei stock benchmark dropped in response to the border announcement. The index had been virtually flat before the news but then slumped to finish down 1.6 percent Monday.Japan had allowed fully vaccinated travelers to waive the last four days of their 14-day quarantine upon testing negative. But under the new restrictions Monday, all citizens and foreign residents reentering Japan must quarantine the full 14 days even if they are fully vaccinated, Kyodo News reported.Japanese citizens and residents returning from countries with confirmed omicron variant cases must quarantine in a government facility for up to 10 days. Japan has no confirmed cases of the variant but is investigating one positive case of a traveler from Namibia, who arrived Sunday.Japan is scheduled to begin administering booster shots later this week, Kishida said.","Japan will take emergency measures for at least one month.

Reuters,Omicron,3,How South African scientists spotted the Omicron COVID variant,http://reut.rs/32NnBhz,"On Friday Nov. 19, Raquel Viana, Head of Science at one of South Africa's biggest private testing labs, sequenced the genes on eight coronavirus samples - and got the shock of her life.The samples, tested in the Lancet laboratory, all bore a large number of mutations, especially on the spike protein that the virus uses to enter human cells.""I was quite shocked at what I was seeing. I questioned whether something had gone wrong in the process,"" she told Reuters, a thought that quickly gave way to ""a sinking feeling that the samples were going to have huge ramifications"".She quickly picked up the phone to her colleague at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg, gene sequencer Daniel Amoako.""I didn't quite know how to break it to them,"" she recalls. She told Amoako, ""To me, it looks like a new lineage.""The discovery of the Omicron variant in southern Africa has caused global alarm, with countries limiting travel from the region and imposing other restrictions for fear it could spread quickly even in vaccinated populations.Amoako and the team at the NICD spent the Nov. 20-21 weekend testing the eight samples which Viana sent them, all of which had the same mutations, he told Reuters on Tuesday.It was so bizarre that Amoako, his colleague Josie Everatt and other colleagues also thought it must be a mistake. Then they remembered that over the week, they'd noticed a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases, of the sort that might indicate a new mutant.In addition, Viana had been alerted to an oddity in the sample earlier this month by a colleague - an S-gene dropout, one of the mutations that now distinguishes the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus from the globally dominant Delta one.The only common variant with that feature was Alpha, ""and we hadn't seen Alpha (in South Africa) since August,"" Everatt recalls thinking as they tested the samples.By Tuesday, Nov. 23, after testing another 32 from around Johannesburg and Pretoria, ""it was clear,"" Amoako said.""It was scary.""BURNING QUESTIONSOn the same Tuesday, the NICD team informed the department of health and other labs across South Africa doing sequencing, which later started coming up with similar results.The same day, the NICD entered the data into the GISAID global science database, and found that Botswana and Hong Kong had also reported cases with the same gene sequence.On Nov. 24, NICD officials and the department notified the World Health Organisation.By that stage, Viana said, more than two-thirds of positive tests in Gauteng, the South African province that includes Pretoria and Johannesburg, were showing the S-gene dropout - a sign that Omicron was already becoming dominant.Thanks to Omicron, South Africa's daily COVID-19 infection rate is expected to quadruple to more than 10,000 by the end of this week, one of the country's leading infectious disease specialists, Salim Abdool Karim, said on Monday.  read more The important questions - how good is the new variant at evading immunity from vaccines or past illness, how severe are the symptoms, compared with previous versions, and how will this differ among age groups - remain to be answered.Three scientists interviewed by Reuters who are working on those questions expect answers in about 3-4 weeks.In the meantime, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is considering introducing mandatory vaccination in some contexts, with the country still reeling from 3 million COVID-19 infections in total during the pandemic and over 89,000 deaths.There is much anger in South Africa at the foreign travel bans - some of it directed at the scientists. Amoako receives some angry messages saying they should just ""stop looking"" for new variants.Wolfgang Preiser, a virologist at Stellenbosch University working on COVID-19, who also has received hate mail, worries that other countries might take this whole saga as a lesson not to be so transparent.""It might encourage other countries to hide things, or rather, just not to look,"" he said.""That's the fear.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonTOKYO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Japan confirmed its first case of the Omicron variant of  coronavirus on Tuesday, a day after closing its borders to all foreigners in one of the world's toughest precautionary measures.But the case could show Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was right in making the swift closure decision, helping to avert the sort of criticism that spurred the resignation in September of predecessor Yoshihide Suga over his handling of the virus.Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said the discovery of the sufferer, a diplomat from Namibia in his thirties who arrived at the Japanese capital's airport of Narita, showed that border controls had worked.""In order to avoid the worst-case situation with Omicron, we'll stay on top of the infection situation in each nation and respond flexibly and fast,"" he added.Kishida had pledged to bolster Japan's response to the pandemic when he campaigned to replace Suga, whose handling of the crisis left many dissatisfied.Border curbs were loosened slightly just weeks ago, and Kishida said he would take responsibility for all criticism of his decision to shut the country again in a move that analysts said aimed to send a strong message.""He's saying that he's a leader who's strong in a crisis, that he can make such a decisive move,"" said Airo Hino, a professor of political science at Waseda University.""The governments before him didn't restrict travel soon enough, and he's taking that into account.

The World Health Organization said on Monday that it carries a very high risk of infection surges, but said no deaths had yet been linked to the new variant.Biden said it was inevitable that Omicron cases would emerge in the United States. But White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said the variant should not cause Americans to change their holiday travel plans as long as they are vaccinated and wear masks.Biden said he believed that existing vaccines would continue to protect against severe disease, but added that his administration was working with vaccine makers Pfizer (PFE.N), Moderna (MRNA.O) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) to develop contingency plans.  read more ""In the event, hopefully unlikely, that updated vaccinations or boosters are needed to respond to this new variant, we will accelerate their development and deployment with every available tool,"" he said.Biden said he would direct the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to make those vaccines available quickly.Travellers wait to process through a security checkpoint at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport before the Thanksgiving holiday in Seattle, Washington, U.S. November 24, 2021.

CNN's Larry Madowo in Paris contributed reporting. As more cases are identified and governments around the world mobilize to respond to Omicron, an urgent meeting of G7 health ministers will be convened on Monday, the United Kingdom said. It also announced on Sunday new domestic public health rules requiring face coverings in shops and on public transport starting this week. Omicron was first identified by scientists in South Africa, who raised alarm over its unusually high number of mutations on Thursday. Since then, at least a dozen other countries have confirmed cases of the new strain, with several other reporting suspected cases. Apart from South Africa, the variant has been found in Botswana, Belgium, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Denmark, United Kingdom, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Czech Republic and Hong Kong.On Sunday, Dutch authorities announced that at least 13 people had tested positive at Amsterdam Schipol airport after traveling from South Africa. The Netherlands' National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) said in a statement that the variant had been detected through the sequencing of 61 positive Covid-19 samples that were obtained at the airport on Friday. It is ""possible that the new variant will be found in more test samples,"" the institution noted.Biostatistician professor Sheila Bird said the test results from Amsterdam were concerning, but that more data was needed. ""There may be household clusters among the 13 Omicron positives or clustering may have been induced by where passengers were seated on the flight from South Africa,"" she told the Science Media Centre, adding that the vaccination status and age distribution of those infected will also need to be considered before any conclusions are made about the variant. The situation should be seen with ""alert rather than alarm until more is known,"" she said.Canadian health officials also confirmed the country's first two Omicron cases in Ottawa on Sunday. Both individuals carrying the variant had recently traveled from Nigeria, according to a joint statement by Deputy Premier and Minister of Health Christine Elliott and Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Kieran Moore. ""We continue to urge the federal government to take the necessary steps to mandate point-of-arrival testing for all travelers irrespective of where they're coming from to further protect against the spread of this new variant,"" the joint statement also said. Variant of concernThe World Health Organization (WHO) has designated the Omicron variant, originally referred to as B.1.1.529, a ""variant of concern."" WHO said on Friday that early evidence suggest the Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa, could pose an increased risk of reinfection and said that some of the mutations detected on the variant were concerning.But WHO stressed that more research is needed to determine whether the variant is more contagious, whether it causes more severe disease, and whether it could evade vaccines.""This variant has a large number of mutations and some of these mutations have some worrying characteristics,"" Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for Covid-19, said in a statement on Friday.""Right now there are many studies that are underway ... so far there's little information but those studies are underway so we need researchers to have the time to carry those out and WHO will inform the public and our partners and our member states as soon as we have more information,"" she added.Travel bans and new quarantine requirementsThe variant's discovery and fast spread across the world is an uncomfortable reminder that the pandemic is far from over. A number of countries have slammed their borders shut to travelers from southern Africa, with the European Union, Japan, Australia, the United States, Canada, Rwanda and many others banning travelers from countries including South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi.But South Africa and some of the other countries hit by the travel bans are pushing back. Speaking in Pretoria on Sunday, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa described the bans as baseless discrimination. ""These restrictions are unjustified and unfairly discriminate against our country and our Southern African sister countries. The prohibition of travel is not informed by science, nor will it be effective in preventing the spread of this variant. The only thing the prohibition on travel will do is to further damage the economies of the affected countries and undermine their ability to respond to, and recover from, the pandemic,"" he said.South Africa's Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation has said the country was being punished for ",Dutch authorities confirm 13 people tested positive for the new strain of Omicron coronavirus.

RIVM virologist Chantal Reusken told national broadcaster NOS that one of the people had ""probably contracted the virus in the Netherlands. How exactly is still under investigation.""Dutch authorities previously believed that the first cases of the Omicron variant had arrived on November 26 after 14 passengers on flights from Johannesburg and Capetown tested positive.Omicron, also known as B.1.1.529, has an unusually high number of mutations, sparking fears that it could evade vaccines and prolong the pandemic. The two newly discovered cases in the Netherlands takes the total number of confirmed Omicron cases in the country to 16, the RIVM said. At least 20 countries and territories have confirmed cases of the Omicron variant so far, with the latest being Brazil.At least 70 countries, among them the United States, imposed new travel restrictions from several African countries after Omicron was first identified by South African scientists. But many health experts have pushed back on the reasoning behind the bans, with studies showing that travel restrictions may only slow the introduction of a new virus or variant by a few weeks.The World Health Organization has repeatedly expressed fears that travel bans hurt economies and discourage countries from being forthright about reporting new viruses or variants. On Tuesday, the WHO again urged countries to avoid implementing knee-jerk travel bans, saying that they do not ""prevent the international spread,"" and ""place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods.""""Putting in place travel bans that target Africa attacks global solidarity,"" WHO Regional Director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti said Sunday.

However, he added, ""In the event that additional measures are needed, we will be prepared."" ""We're working with Pfizer, Moderna, and (Johnson & Johnson) to develop contingency plans for modifications to vaccines or boosters if they're needed. And we will ensure that the (US Food and Drug Administration) and (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) review them as fast as possible while maintaining their rigorous scientific protocols,"" Zients added. The administration, Zients said, is planning for how to support the manufacturers through the process -- if needed -- and how to ""rapidly get shots in arms.""""And we know how to do that, given the experience we've had in the last year,"" Zients said, adding that the administration would deploy federal pharmacy programs, set up mass vaccination sites and go to community health centers and clinics. ""All that type of planning is part of our contingency planning so we could get shots in arms efficiently and effectively,"" he continued. Zients also urged adults to receive their Covid-19 booster shots, a key point in the administration's current strategy of protecting Americans from the emerging variant.During the briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci -- the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser -- said Omicron looks very different from the now-dominant Delta variant. He specifically noted that the mutations in Omicron ""have been associated with increased transmissibility and immune evasion, whereas other of the mutations have not yet been characterized as to their functional capability."" Fauci said while the variant carries many mutations, vaccines are likely to protect people against severe disease at the least, even if the variant doesn't stimulate the immune system in the same way as older variants do. Research on the new variant is rapidly evolving. On Monday, Fauci told CNN's ""The Lead"" that while PCR Covid-19 detection tests and some rapid antigen tests could detect the new variant, it wasn't clear whether all rapid tests could detect it. But Zients confirmed Tuesday that the FDA believes ""the high-volume PCR and rapid antigen tests widely used in the US will be effective in detecting the variant.""                                                         The severity and transmissibilty of the new variant are still being studied.  There are anecdotal reports suggesting that most cases of the Omicron variant Covid-19 have been mild so far. But scientists say it will take weeks to know how dangerous the new variant is. Fauci told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday that the administration expects to know more about Omicron in about a week and a half.                                                             Later this week, Biden is expected to unveil the federal strategy to address Covid-19 this winter. He has been clear that so far, further travel restrictions are not anticipated. And during a speech about the new variant on Monday, the President said he anticipates the US will approach Covid-19 this winter ""not with shutdowns or lockdowns, but with more widespread vaccinations, boosters, testing, and more."" The Omicron variant hasn't yet been detected in the United States. However, public health officials have repeatedly emphasized that the current travel restrictions on countries in southern Africa won't necessarily prevent the variant's arrival to the US. Rather, they will give the country some lead time to prepare for it. ""(T)ravel restrictions can slow the speed of Omicron, it cannot prevent it,"" the President said on Monday. ""But here's what it does: It gives us time. It gives us time to take more actions, to move quicker, to make sure people understand you have to get your vaccine.""

He's all in on doing everything he can to get Americans vaccinated and politely asking them to mask up, but he's not likely to go the direction of some European leaders and push lockdowns any time soon.What we know and don't know about OmicronCoronavirus variants: Here's what we knowCases, deaths, vaccinations by countryFAQ: Your top questions answeredAll the latest on the pandemicA version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Biden had been trying to find balance, saying that ""this variant is a cause for concern, not a cause for panic.""He raised several points to drill home:We don't know everything we need to know about Omicron. It's not time to panic about a new variant, which was first identified in South Africa. It's also not time to ignore it.Omicron is coming to the US no matter what. The virus is going to come here, regardless of new travel restrictions that went into effect Monday. Those, he said, have been put in place to slow the speed of the variant's spread and allow the US to prepare, not to stop it from entering the country. Some experts think it may be here already.Vaccines. vaccines. vaccines. The best way to protect yourself is through vaccination and booster shots.Mask indoors at public places even if you're vaccinated. Biden asked people to start wearing masks indoors, regardless of vaccination status, to help stop the spread of Covid-19. In the UK, where Omicron cases have been identified, masks are once again required in shops.Stay tuned. The federal government is working with drug makers in case an update to vaccine recommendations is needed, although Biden said additional measures are likely not necessary. ""Should"" get a booster. That last point was particularly interesting -- that Biden would even be mentioning the possibility for updated vaccine protocols. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday strengthened its booster recommendation specifically because of the Omicron variant. Instead of saying all vaccinated people over age 18 ""may"" get a booster, the CDC now says they all ""should.""So what was the telling moment? The telling moment came after Biden's remarks, when he was asked to explain his comment about a forthcoming plan to deal with Omicron -- which he kept mispronouncing as ""Omnicron."" (Aside: It's pronounced ""OH-muh-kron,"" according to CNN's health team.)Biden said, ""On Thursday, I'll be putting forward a detailed strategy outlining how we're going to fight Covid this winter. Not with shutdowns or lockdowns, but with more widespread vaccinations, boosters, testing and more."" A reporter followed up and asked Biden why lockdowns are off the table. ""If people are vaccinated and wear their mask, there's no need for lockdown,"" he said.This comment was both true and confounding because what we've learned over the past few months is that a lot of Americans aren't going to get vaccinated or wear masks.What I heard from Biden's response, however, is that it doesn't matter how a new variant spreads -- the federal government isn't going to pick a political fight over lockdowns. The country plowed through the Delta surge this summer and fall and emerged with many Americans bucking the idea of masks in schools or vaccine requirements at jobs.Biden's response differs from the one in parts of Europe, where some towns and countries have returned to some form of lockdown as Covid-19 cases and deaths rise there due to the Delta variant. The Washington Post visited a town put in semi-lockdown in Belgium and reported on lockdowns in Slovakia and Austria and a curfew in the Netherlands. Western European countries, so far, have had generally lower numbers of Covid-19 deaths per 100,000 people than the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.New conspiracy theory.

Omicron -- or the B.1.1.529 strain of novel coronavirus -- has already spurred international travel bans. The World Health Organization officially called it a ""variant of concern"" on Friday. The variant has not yet been detected in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a Saturday update. ""But it's fairly likely we'll see cases,"" said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health.""It ought to redouble our efforts to use the tools that we have, which are vaccinations and boosters -- and to be sure we're getting those to the rest of the world, too,"" Collins told CNN on Sunday. ""It also means we need to pay attention to those mitigation strategies that people are just really sick of, like wearing masks when you're indoors with other people who might not be vaccinated, and keeping that social distance,"" he said. ""I know, America -- you're really tired of hearing those things. But the virus is not tired of us. And it's shapeshifting itself.""  Why Omicron 'looks different' from other variantsAs coronavirus keeps spreading, new mutations -- and new variants -- are expected. ""We have seen a lot of variants pop up over the last five, six months, and most of them have not amounted to much. This looks different,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.The Omicron variant has an unusually high number of mutations, with more than 30 mutations in the spike protein alone, South African genomic scientists said last week. Spike proteins are the structures used by a virus to get into the cells it attacks.And ""10 or more"" of the mutations are on the receptor binding domain, which ""binds to the cells in your nasal pharynx and in your lung,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci told NBC on Sunday. ""In other words, the profile of the mutations strongly suggest that it's going to have an advantage in transmissibility,"" the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said. When experts looked at other variants, Jha said, it usually took several months for those strains to be dominant -- in other words, the most common strain of the virus spreading in one area. ""This one has become dominant very quickly in South Africa in the regions where it's been found -- within a matter of days to weeks, as opposed to months,"" Jha said. ""Now, the number of cases in South Africa is quite low, so it can be for other reasons as well -- not just because it's more transmissible. But the speed with which it has taken off is really unlike anything we've seen before.""Collins said it's not yet clear whether the Omicron variant is more contagious than the Delta variant.""It certainly shows the signs of being able to spread quickly,"" he said. ""What we don't know is whether it can compete with Delta.""It's also too early to tell whether the Omicron variant causes more severe illness, Collins said. In short: ""There's still much we do not know about Omicron,"" epidemiologist and infectious disease expert Dr. Celine Gounder said. ""We're still learning,"" Gounder said Sunday. ""As we were saying very early in the pandemic, pandemics are not about panicking. They're about policies, protocols and practice. And in this case, that means doing the work of characterizing the virus.""Don't be surprised by renewed Covid-19 restrictions, expert says A growing number of countries have confirmed cases of the Omicron variant. Canada joined that list Sunday, when health officials confirmed two cases in Ottawa, Ontario. Both people had recently traveled from Nigeria and are isolating, Canadian health officials said.If the Omicron variant isn't already in the US, it's bound to be ""soon,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.""It's going to make its way around the world. It looks like that way,"" Schaffner said Saturday.And that could prompt a return to stricter Covid-19 mitigation efforts.""I think we may, indeed, be in for a phase of many more masks, much more social distancing, and more restrictions and obligations for vaccination going forward,"" Schaffner said.News of the variant spread as Americans packed airports at almost pre-pandemic levels for Thanksgiving and at the start of the holiday season: The Transportation Security Administration said it screened about 2.3 million people at airports across the country Wednesday, making it the busiest day at security checkpoints since March 2020.

NYT,Meta,1,Facebook renames itself Meta,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/technology/facebook-meta-name-change.html,"The social network, under fire for spreading misinformation and other issues, said the change was part of its bet on a next digital frontier called the metaverse.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Mike IsaacSAN FRANCISCO — Facebook rose to prominence over the past two decades with some of the world’s most recognizable branding: a big blue-and-white letter F.No longer. On Thursday, the social networking giant took an unmistakable step toward an overhaul, de-emphasizing Facebook’s name and rebranding itself as Meta. The change was accompanied by a new corporate logo designed like an infinity-shaped symbol that was slightly askew. Facebook and its other apps, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, will remain but under the Meta umbrella.The move punctuates how Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, plans to refocus his Silicon Valley company on what he sees as the next digital frontier, which is the unification of disparate digital worlds into something called the metaverse. At the same time, renaming Facebook may help distance the company from the social networking controversies it is facing, including how it is used to spread hate speech and misinformation.“I’ve been thinking a lot about our identity” with this new chapter, Mr. Zuckerberg said, speaking at a virtual event on Thursday to showcase Facebook’s technological bets on the future. “Over time, I hope we’re seen as a metaverse company.”With the change, Mr. Zuckerberg telegraphed that his company was going beyond today’s social networking, which Facebook has been built on since it was founded 17 years ago. Having Facebook as the corporate name when the company now owned many apps and was fundamentally about connecting people was no longer tenable, he said.That was especially the case, Mr. Zuckerberg said, as Facebook has committed to building a composite universe melding online, virtual and augmented worlds that people can seamlessly traverse. He has said that this concept, known as the metaverse, can be the next major social platform and that several tech companies will build it over the next 10-plus years. On Monday, Facebook had signaled its intent to be a big player when it separated its virtual reality and augmented reality business into a division known as Facebook Reality Labs.But evolving Facebook into a metaverse company will take time since the concept is theoretical and may take years to achieve. Facebook and its sister apps also remain a giant business, generating more than $86 billion in annual revenue and serving more than 3.5 billion people globally.The timing of the name change has a double advantage. Facebook has grappled with some of the most intense scrutiny in its history in recent weeks. Lawmakers and the public have criticized its Instagram photo-sharing app for hurting some teenagers’ self-esteem and the company has faced questions for its role in amplifying misinformation and stirring unrest with inflammatory content.The outcry reached a fever pitch after Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee, leaked internal documents that showed how much the company knew about the harmful effects it was causing. Findings from Ms. Haugen’s documents were first published by The Wall Street Journal and then other media organizations, including The New York Times.The revelations have led to a slew of congressional hearings, as well as legal and regulatory scrutiny. On Monday, Ms. Haugen spoke to British lawmakers in Parliament and urged them to regulate Facebook. On Tuesday, Facebook told its employees to “preserve internal documents and communications since 2016” that pertain to its businesses because governments and legislative bodies had started inquiries into its operations.Corporate rebrands are rare but have precedent. They have generally been used to signal a company’s structural reorganization or to distance a company from a toxic reputation.In 2015, Google restructured itself under a new parent company, Alphabet, dividing itself into separate companies to better differentiate its internet search business from the moonshot bets it was making in other areas. In 2011, Netflix announced plans to cleave its video business into two parts, briefly renaming its DVD-by-mail arm as Qwikster. After The Verge reported last week that Facebook might change its name, social media erupted with less desirable comparisons.

NYT,Meta,2,8 Companies That Changed Their Names to Signal a Strategy Shift,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/business/meta-fb.html,"Facebook said on Thursday that it was rebranding as Meta, taking a step to distance itself from the controversies it faces. How has this corporate strategy worked for other companies?Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Jenny Gross and Christine HauserRebranding a company amid a crisis or as a way to signal a shift in focus has been a popular corporate strategy for decades. But does it really help companies shed their image issues, or do customers see a name change as window dressing?According to one expert, rebranding is often used to update a company’s name to reflect cultural changes in consumer behavior or values, as when Kentucky Fried Chicken became KFC, dropping the “fried” as consumers increasingly looked for healthier choices. In other instances, brands rename themselves after mergers or acquisitions, to signal a new direction, or to distance themselves from negative publicity.“The success of a name change depends upon companies educating existing customers about the rationale for the name change in a way that is compelling,” said Jill Avery, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School who focuses on brand management. “If the name change appears illegitimate, inauthentic or done for the wrong reasons, firms risk injuring their relationships with consumers.”In the case of Facebook, which said on Thursday that it was changing its corporate name to Meta, the downside risk was minimal for the company, she said, since it changed its corporate brand and not its product brand.Here’s a look at a few major corporate rebranding efforts over the decades and how they fared.The company aimed to breathe fresh life into the brand in 2019, when it dropped the word “Donuts” from its name. Customers would still recognize its colors and font, but the company wanted to nod to the chain’s beverage sales, which accounted for more than half of its business.The popularity of its longtime slogan, “America Runs on Dunkin’,” was also a compelling reason to simplify the brand name.But the company said its focus on doughnuts remained in place.Neeru Paharia, an associate professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business whose research focuses on brand signaling, said that the rebranding allowed Dunkin’ to diversify its product offerings. “There was a huge opportunity in the breakfast market,” she said. “And yet, at the same time, everyone knows if you want a doughnut, that’s where you go.”Just before the name change took effect, Tony Weisman, then the chief marketing officer of Dunkin’ Donuts in the United States, said the relationship the company had with customers was similar to that between friends who are “on a first-name basis.”In 2001, Philip Morris announced it was changing the name of its parent company to Altria Group, part of an effort to shake negative associations with the lawsuits against its cigarette brands.Steven C. Parrish, the parent company’s senior vice president for corporate affairs at the time of the name change, said on Friday that the company knew that a name change would not solve its problems.“We knew that changing the name was not going to make all the lawsuits go away — it was not going to change the fact that people get sick and die from smoking and that it’s addictive,” Mr. Parrish said. “But we did think that changing the name would help us explain what the company was, which was a big consumer-products holding company, and not just a tobacco company.”Companies rebrand for reasons other than to turn over a new page after public relations nightmares. In 2015, Google reorganized under a new name, Alphabet, as a way to separate its moneymaking assets from the unprofitable parts of its company. The company is now worth $1.5 trillion more than it was when it was called Google, DealBook reported. But it is difficult to separate how much of that increase may be attributable to its name change versus its changed corporate structure.The Alphabet name change was not the first time Google rebranded. In 1996, Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, called their company BackRub — a reference to its ability to analyze links that direct users from one site to another.Weight Watchers changed its name to WW in 2018 as it announced a major effort to turn the weight-loss company into a wellness company. It came at a time when the body-positivity movement was gaining steam, and the company faced increased competition from companies focused on self-care and nutrition.“While WW remains the global leader in weight loss, it now also welcomes anyone who wants to build healthy habits,” the company said in a statement at the time.In 1998, British Petroleum P.L.C. said it would acquire the American oil company Amoco for $48.2 billion. Under its new name, BP Amoco became the largest producer of both oil and natural gas in the United States. After the merger, a new approach to branding aimed to position the company as an","Facebook said on Thursday it was rebranding as Meta, taking a step to distance itself from the controversies it faces.

Anyone can read what you share.By Mike IsaacSAN FRANCISCO — One of Mark Zuckerberg’s first steps toward building the metaverse may be physical instead of virtual.Meta, the social media company formerly known as Facebook, has discussed opening retail stores that will eventually span the world, said people with knowledge of the project and company documents viewed by The New York Times. The stores would be used to introduce people to devices made by the company’s Reality Labs division, such as virtual reality headsets and, eventually, augmented reality glasses, they said.These devices are gateways to the metaverse, a futuristic digital world where people move from virtual to augmented versions of reality almost seamlessly. Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, last week renamed his company Meta and laid out a vision for pursuing the metaverse as the next social platform. The stores would help show people that virtual reality and augmented reality can be fun and exciting, exactly the way Mr. Zuckerberg sees it.The aim of the stores is to make the world “more open and connected,” according to the company documents viewed by The Times. They are also intended to spark emotions like “curiosity, closeness,” as well as a sense of feeling “welcomed” while experimenting with headsets in a “judgment free journey,” according to the documents.Discussions about physical stores predated Facebook’s rebranding by many months, with serious work on the initiative having started last year, the people said. And the project, which is still in development, may not proceed, they said. But if Meta moves forward with stores, it would be a first for a tech giant that has existed largely digitally, with more than 3.5 billion people using its apps such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.A Meta spokeswoman said the company couldn’t confirm plans for stores but said its latest virtual reality headset was “in high demand” and that its hardware was available at partner retailers. Mr. Zuckerberg has talked up the metaverse as his company grapples with regulatory and societal challenges. Frances Haugen, a former employee turned whistle-blower, amassed thousands of pages of internal documents and recently shared them with lawmakers and the news media. She has said that Facebook was not doing enough to protect society from the harms it causes. Her disclosures have drawn scrutiny from legislators and regulators, though it is unclear how strong her case is.Skepticism about the metaverse also abounds. While Meta’s Reality Labs division has had modest past success with the Oculus Quest 2, a low-priced headset that was popular last year, virtual reality remains a niche market for hobbyists and enthusiasts. The hardware is often costly and can be difficult to use. Some people have reported that the headsets nauseate them.“We are, at best guess, at least five to 10 years out from a fully fleshed out Meta product or service,” said Tim Derdenger, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business. He said what Meta was working on was akin to the computer game Second Life from the early 2000s, calling it “a second shot at a Second Life-like service, but that is hopefully more immersive.”Still, Mr. Zuckerberg has said he sees the moment to build what he believes will be the next major shift in computing platforms since the smartphone era. In that future, Mr. Zuckerberg’s apps would no longer be beholden to the rules dictated by Apple and Google, which own the app stores that distribute Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.Technology companies opening their own stores is not new. Gateway, a personal-computer maker, had its own stores in the 1990s. Apple has retail stores so people can test out devices and get their questions answered. Microsoft, Amazon and others have followed with their own stores as well.In recent years, Meta had experimented with some physical retail efforts. It opened “pop-up” kiosks at airports and a pop-up store in Manhattan’s SoHo district to show its Oculus hardware products. It also had a pop-up location with Macy’s in 2018, with the aim of bringing more small business onto the platform. Should Meta’s new stores proceed, they would feature products such as Portal devices — teleconferencing gadgets that let people video chat over Facebook — as well as the Oculus headsets, the company documents said. The stores could also include voice-activated sunglasses that Meta developed with Ray-Ban, which people can use to take photos and video.A tech giant in trouble.

NYT,Meta,4,Meta plans to remove thousands of sensitive ad-targeting categories.,https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1458200274137387008,"Meta, the social media company formerly known as Facebook, said on Tuesday that it planned to eliminate advertisers’ ability to target people with promotions based on their interactions with content related to health, race and ethnicity, political affiliation, religion, sexual orientation and thousands of other topics. The move, which takes effect on Jan. 19, affects advertisers on Meta’s apps such as Facebook, Instagram and Messenger and the company’s audience network, which places ads in third-party apps. The Silicon Valley company said it was making the changes to limit the way that its targeting tools can be abused. In the past, these features have been used to discriminate against people or to spam them with unwanted messaging. “We’ve heard concerns from experts that targeting options like these could be used in ways that lead to negative experiences for people in underrepresented groups,” said Graham Mudd, a vice president of product marketing for Meta. Meta relies on targeted advertising for the bulk of its $86 billion in annual revenue. The company has excelled at giving advertisers a place to personalize promotions, with brands often able to aim their ads at Facebook, Instagram and Messenger users who are interested in topics as specific as L.G.B.T.Q. culture or Catholicism. Such tailored ads often have a better chance of sparking a sale or prompting users to join a particular Facebook group or support an online organization than more generalized ads. But Meta has also faced a litany of complaints about advertisers abusing these targeting abilities. Before the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol, for example, advertisers used targeting tools to direct promotions for body armor, gun holsters and rifle enhancements at far-right militia groups on Facebook. In 2020, auditors concluded that Facebook had not done enough to protect people who use its service from discriminatory posts and ads. In 2019, the Department of Housing and Urban Development sued Facebook for allowing landlords and home sellers to unfairly restrict who could see ads for their properties on the platform based on characteristics like race, religion and national origin. And in 2017, ProPublica found that Facebook’s algorithms had generated ad categories for users interested in topics such as “Jew hater” and “how to burn jews.” In response to the abuse, the social network has tweaked its ad-targeting tools over time. In 2018, it removed 5,000 ad-targeting classifications to keep advertisers from excluding certain users. Facebook also disabled the anti-Semitic ad categories after the ProPublica report. But Meta’s latest changes may be unpopular with the millions of organizations that rely on the company’s tools to expand their audiences and build their businesses. Advertising on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger that is finely tuned to people’s interests is often more affordable and effective than advertising on broadcast television and other media. Those organizations include political groups and advocacy groups, many of which rely on the platform for fund-raising. Last year, political campaigns and nongovernmental organizations criticized Facebook when it temporarily removed political advertising from its sites around the presidential election; the restriction was lifted in March. Some campaigns said the move had benefited incumbents and larger organizations that didn’t count on small donations through Facebook. Republicans and Democrats blasted Meta’s changes on Tuesday. Reid Vineis, a vice president of Majority Strategies, a digital ad-buying firm that works with Republicans, said in an emailed statement that the social network had gone from being “the gold standard for political advertising” to throwing roadblocks between campaigns and voters. “This decision is harmful to nonprofit and public affairs advertisers across the board and will result in fewer charitable donations, limited public debate and a less informed public,” he said. Mr. Mudd said that the new policies would be unpopular with some, but that the company had decided that moving forward was the best course. “Like many of our decisions, this was not a simple choice and required a balance of competing interests where there was advocacy in both directions,” he said. He added that some of the ad changes had been under discussion since 2016. Augustine Fou, an independent ad fraud researcher, said advertising on Facebook and its other apps had long worked “better than any other display ads elsewhere because Facebook has years of people volunteering information, and it’s pretty accurate.” He added that personalized advertising outside the platform often relied on guesswork that was “so wildly inaccurate that when you try to target based on that, you’re worse off than trying to spray and pray.” Yet Meta has often struggled with how to take advantage of consumer data without abusing it. “Of course, Facebook can deduce that you’re gay, or that you’re African American, but then ","The move, which takes effect on January 19, affects advertisers on Meta's apps such as Facebook, Instagram and Messenger.

NYT,Meta,5,When a Logo Doesn’t Risk It All: Meta’s Brand Is Designed for Unknown Worlds,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/technology/facebook-meta-new-logo.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes,"The emblem for Facebook’s new parent company is built for the metaverse, even if it disappoints in the real world.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Gray BeltranWhen Mark Zuckerberg announced last month that Facebook was changing its name, the company published a sleek animation online that showed logos of all its apps and products fusing together to form a shimmering vision of the future: a two-tone blue infinity symbol next to the word “Meta.”The new symbol and name change were nods to Mr. Zuckerberg’s plans to refocus the Silicon Valley giant toward what he sees as the unification of disparate digital worlds into the so-called metaverse, the immersive, interconnected online space largely enabled by augmented and virtual reality. “The metaverse is the next frontier in connecting people,” he said in an announcement.To design experts, the change by a scandal-plagued company was the latest example of efforts by corporate America to create brands that are less unique and ultimately less offensive. It was also a reflection of the growing challenge for corporate identities to exist in many different sizes and digital settings at once, from V.R. headsets to smartwatches — a challenge that is magnified for Meta as it tries to establish an identity for something that largely doesn’t exist yet.“It checks a lot of boxes,” said Michael Evamy, the author of “Logo,” an anthology of corporate brands and logos. “It’s very simple. It’s very visible at all scales. It’s blue.” (Blue, he noted, is historically a color associated with safety and trustworthiness. The infinity symbol, devoid of corners and jagged edges, can be seen as nonthreatening.)“But in a way it kind of looks exactly like you’d expect,” Mr. Evamy added. “Kind of underwhelming and risk-averse.”Users and lawmakers worldwide are increasingly scrutinizing the wide reach of Facebook, whose products — including Instagram and WhatsApp — are used by more than 3.6 billion people every month. Even as Facebook grew to become one of the most valuable companies in the world, it spent the last several years moving from one embarrassing scandal to the next. Most recently, a former employee turned whistle-blower released a vast trove of internal documents, arguing that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook routinely placed profit over the well-being of people.Mr. Zuckerberg said last month that the name change was a reflection of how much Facebook had evolved. “Right now our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can’t possibly represent everything we’re doing today, let alone in the future,” he said.Facebook has long been associated with its lowercase “f” logo — a simple mark but one that became globally recognizable as Facebook grew. The company’s other apps also have bold and colorful logos, which are staying as part of the rebranding.Because Mr. Zuckerberg’s future vision rests on virtual reality, the company wanted a new logo that felt more dynamic and immersive. In March, the company began developing a logo by focusing “solely on exploring concepts with motion, dimensionality and perspective,” Zach Stubenvoll, Sam Halle and Marian Chiao, members of its internal design team, said in an email.When using a V.R. headset, people often use a controller to draw boundary lines of their virtual experience. Meta’s designers said the color loop in the new logo that eventually twists into the infinity symbol was inspired by those boundary lines.The design community’s response to Facebook’s change has been largely muted.“This symbol just doesn’t get you excited about the metaverse,” Mr. Evamy said. “The opportunity they’ve missed is to produce something really exciting and transformative in its own way.”Many other brands have very similar infinity-symbol logos, including those of web development software sold by Microsoft, a model of Top Flite golf balls, a wealth management firm and the rock band Hoobastank. A service owned by Meta called Boomerang also uses an infinity symbol.A tech giant in trouble. The leak of internal documents by a former Facebook employee has provided an intimate look at the operations of the secretive social media company and renewed calls for better regulations of the company’s wide reach into the lives of its users.How it began.

Wall Street was already uneasy.Follow our latest coverage of business, markets and economy.By Matt Phillips and Eshe Nelson Data delayed at least 15 minutesSource: FactSetBy: Ella KoezeJust as a worrying new variant of the coronavirus has begun to spread, the Federal Reserve chair signaled on Tuesday that the central bank could reduce its support for the economy more quickly, sending a shudder through Wall Street and pushing the S&P 500 negative for November.A sell-off already in progress accelerated after the chair, Jerome H. Powell, told a Senate committee that inflation was likely to persist well into next year and that the Fed would consider tapering off its purchases of government bonds “perhaps a few months sooner” than previously expected.The bond-buying program has been a crucial factor in the swift rise of stocks since the start of the pandemic — the S&P 500 has more than doubled since March 2020 — and the market’s response to Mr. Powell’s comments was immediate. The benchmark index fell sharply and closed down 1.9 percent.“I think it’s a major moment,” said Nathan Koppikar, a portfolio manager at the San Francisco hedge fund Orso Partners, which often places bets that certain stocks will fall. “The Fed is finally sort of putting their stake in the ground and saying that the bubble has gone on long enough.”As the S&P 500 struck bottom in March 2020, the Fed was restarting the type of money-printing program, known as quantitative easing, that it put in place because of the financial crisis of 2008. The central bank pumped trillions of dollars into the financial system by purchasing assets such as Treasury bonds with newly created dollars — a key source of momentum for the seemingly relentless rally in share prices.That program was never going to last forever, however, and this year the Fed began to discuss dialing back its bond purchases. After some jitters this fall, investors seemed to have come to grips with the Fed’s plans. But Mr. Powell’s statements about possibly responding to persistent inflation — which the central bank had long described as “transitory” — with more aggressive tapering amounts to a significant milestone.“The retiring of ‘transitory’ means we’re also retiring quantitative easing, which has overstayed its welcome,” said Rick Rieder, the head of the global allocation investment team at the money management firm BlackRock in New York.Without a regular influx of newly created dollars into capital markets, stocks could be in for a rockier run than they’ve had in more than a year. “Volatility will be higher,” Mr. Rieder said.An earlier end to the Fed’s bond-buying program could be a tacit signal of a sooner-arriving increase in interest rates. Short-term bond yields, which are heavily influenced by expectations for Fed rate increases, spiked on Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury note rose to 0.56 percent from roughly 0.43 percent in relatively short order, but some of that surge melted away through the afternoon, and the yield ended the day at roughly 0.52 percent.Stock prices were falling around the world before Mr. Powell’s testimony as investors struggled to understand the danger posed by the Omicron variant, which began roiling markets last week. The Stoxx Europe 600 closed down 0.9 percent; in Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Japan and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong each dropped more than 1.5 percent.Concerns about potential economic damage from the variant, such as restrictions on travel, hammered crude oil prices again on Tuesday. Futures prices for benchmark American crude tumbled more than 4 percent, and were down roughly 20 percent since the start of November.Taken at face value, such a sell-off implies that investors see growing risks that the Omicron variant will set off a global economic slowdown. But some investors think the prices are likely to reverse.“Is there really a reason for oil to be trading down to 66 bucks a barrel when we were up north of $80? Are we literally locking down the entire global economy?” asked Jack Janasiewicz, a portfolio manager with Natixis Investment Managers. “It’s an overreaction.”Investors remain particularly attuned to the effectiveness of vaccines against the new variant. The chief executive of Moderna, a vaccine maker, said in an interview on Tuesday that there could be a “material drop” in the effectiveness of current vaccines to Omicron. The executive, Stéphane Bancel, told The Financial Times that it might be months before an Omicron-specific vaccine could be produced at scale, and he added that it would be risky to shift the company’s entire vaccine production while other variants were still prevalent.Financial markets have been unsteady since the identification of the Omicron variant in southern Africa late last week.

WP,Meta,1,Facebook is changing its name to Meta as it focuses on the virtual world,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/28/facebook-meta-name-change/,"Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta on Thursday, moving aggressively to distance itself from a social-media business embroiled in crisis and rebrand itself as a forward-looking creator of a new digital world known as the “metaverse.”In a 75-minute online presentation, CEO Mark Zuckerberg urged users to adjust their thinking about the company, which he said had outgrown its ubiquitous and problematic social media app — a platform that will continue to be known as Facebook. Instead, he said, the company plans to focus on what Zuckerberg described as the next wave of computing: a virtual universe where people will roam freely as avatars, attending virtual business meetings, shopping in virtual stores and socializing at virtual get-togethers.“From now on, we’re going to be the metaverse first. Not Facebook first,” Zuckerberg said at Connect, the company’s annual event focused on virtual and augmented reality. “Facebook is one of the most-used products in the world. But increasingly, it doesn’t encompass everything that we do. Right now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can’t possibly represent everything we are doing.”Want to get a morning briefing straight to your phone? Text JOIN to 63706 to sign up.The move comes as Facebook is mired in controversy over allegations that it has privately and meticulously tracked real-world harms exacerbated by its platforms, ignored warnings from its employees about the risks of their design decisions and exposed vulnerable communities around the world to a cocktail of dangerous content. After a whistleblower this month turned over tens of thousands of internal company documents to Congress and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, lawmakers and critics have called for urgent action to rein in the tech giant.The revelations by whistleblower Frances Haugen represent arguably the most profound challenge yet to Zuckerberg and his company, which ranks as the largest social media platform in the world. Critics swiftly criticized the move, comparing it to the crisis strategy employed by tobacco company Phillip Morris when it became clear that the company had long known that cigarettes damage human health.What is the ‘metaverse’? Facebook says it’s the future of the Internet.“Don’t forget that when Phillip Morris changed [its] name to Altria it was still selling cigarettes that caused cancer,” tweeted Democratic lawyer Marc Elias.Zuckerberg said the rebrand would heed the “lessons” of the past, noting in a blog post that privacy and safety would be built into the new generation of products “from Day One” — a clear nod to Facebook’s record of eroding trust. In his keynote address, he also nodded to Facebook’s problems, saying, “The last few years have been humbling for me and my company in a lot of ways.”But Facebook’s trust deficit is real. The crisis brought on by the Facebook Papers, which were provided to Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission in response to a whistleblower lawsuit, follows other scandals in recent years, such as Russian disinformation surrounding the 2016 presidential election and the Cambridge Analytica crisis that highlighted the improper sharing of personal data.The current crisis is more existential for the company, because the harm comes from within rather than from an outsider abusing the service. The Facebook Papers also touch every aspect of the service, exposing fundamental flaws in the architecture of its algorithms, the design of the platform, and its policies, while the harms exposed around mental health and polarization hit close to home for many Americans.How Facebook’s ‘metaverse’ became a political strategy in WashingtonThe Facebook Papers were obtained by a consortium of news organizations, including The Washington Post. Facebook has called them a “coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company.”One of the major allegations of the Facebook Papers is that the company built and deployed social media technology without having a grasp of its harmful effects. Critics fear the same problems would plague the metaverse — only the stakes could be higher, as Zuckerberg pitched that people would essentially live part of their lives in his virtual world.He sought to offset potential criticism by saying in his presentation that the next generation of Internet services would be built with greater “humility and openness,” and take the “lessons” of the past into account. But critics and some former insiders questioned that commitment.“I was thinking during the keynote, who will be the cops in the metaverse?” said Katie Harbath, founder and CEO of consultancy Anchor Change and former Facebook public policy director. “The first few years may seem great because not that many people are on the service, but the more that come on, the more bad actors. And then the company plays catch-up.”Five points for anger, one for a ‘like’: How Facebook’s formula fostered rage and mis",Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the company has outgrown its social-media app. CEO Mark Zuckerberg urged users to adjust their thinking about the company.,META: Mark Evading True Accountability,fitting … meta for all the metadata they stealing from you,Negative,Negative Disgust,Facebook name change to Meta
WP,Meta,2,Analysis: Zuckerberg’s Meta promises a “future” these video games delivered years ago,https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/10/29/facebook-meta-rebrand-metaverse-video-games/?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social,"In addition to announcing Facebook’s rebranding to Meta on Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg delivered a number of lofty promises about the metaverse and its features. It was billed as the company’s vision for the “future.” But much of what Zuckerberg promised about the metaverse exists today in video games.While the metaverse isn’t here and doesn’t offer the interoperability Zuckerberg and many other gaming and tech CEOs aspire to realize in designing the next evolution of the Internet, building blocks and runways had been established years before Zuckerberg publicly announced his intent to turn Facebook into a “metaverse company” only a few months ago.“I am dedicating our energy to this more than any other company in the world,” Zuckerberg declared at the end of his presentation Thursday. That may be true moving forward, but Chinese conglomerate Tencent has been pouring billions into investments into the metaverse for some time now. In this regard, Facebook/Meta is playing catch up.A number of Zuckerberg’s promised future experiences can already be found in games, albeit separately. The metaverse vision is to unite them in ways that would make navigating everything as seamless as clicking a link on today’s Internet. That will be the challenge for game-making companies like Roblox and Epic Games. But as far as the experiences Zuckerberg aims to create, they’ve already accomplished that feat.Zuckerberg: “Importantly, you should be able to bring your avatar and digital items across different apps and experiences in the metaverse.”If you have children, you may have heard of “Roblox,” but “Roblox” is not just a kids game. It is an already robust internal metaverse-like platform where moving avatars and items across apps is already possible. Your “Roblox” avatar and belongings (bought by the game’s in-game currency, Robux) persist and stay with you no matter which game experiences you choose to enter while using “Roblox.”That has been the huge appeal of “Roblox” for almost a decade. You do not enter other player’s worlds as famous game characters like “Halo’s” Master Chief or “Tomb Raider’s” Lara Croft or use any of a number of predetermined avatars like “Fortnite.” While crude, your “Roblox” avatar is a unique expression of yourself built from the game’s offerings. And you use that avatar to play anything from hide-and-seek to an adaptation of “Squid Game” while using “Roblox.”League x Louis Vuitton. 100 Thieves x Gucci. Video game fashion is becoming a big business.What makes “Roblox” metaverse-like and not the metaverse is explained by what Zuckerberg said next: “You want to know that when you buy something or create something, that your items will be useful in a lot of contexts and you’re not going to be locked into one world or platform.”Your avatar and items in “Roblox” are only useful in “Roblox.” A true metaverse means taking your “Roblox” personalized avatar and bringing it into Facebook … excuse me, Meta’s Horizon VR platform, or “Minecraft,” or “Fortnite,” or into a hypothetical Netflix virtual theater event online. No company or CEO can make this happen by themselves. This would require unprecedented coordination among many of the world’s tech companies for standardization. The key takeaway there? In order for Zuckerberg to deliver the metaverse, he’ll need other companies to work with him.Zuckerberg: “Soon we’re going to be introducing a social version of [Horizon] Home, where you can invite your friends to join you as avatars. You’ll be able to hang out, watch videos together and jump into apps together.”In 2017, Steam’s VR platform already had a “home” type experience that expanded into social features, including inviting your friends over. Much of these environments already look like the lush, billionaire-style, sunlit homes among mountain cliffs that Zuckerberg featured in his presentation.To be clear, Steam has not made many updates to this, and other VR programs like “VRChat” have already far exceeded what SteamVR offers (and what Zuckerberg promises). In “VRChat,” creators have been able to build their own hangout homes and invite everyone and their wacky VR avatars in to hang out and play games, talk and see each other’s expressions and movements in real time.Virtual reality has real problems. Here’s how game developers seek to delete them.Marne Levine (Meta chief business officer): “In the metaverse, you’ll be able to teleport not just to any place, but to any time as well. Ancient Rome. Imagine standing on the streets, hearing the sounds, visiting the markets, to get a sense of the rhythm of life over 2,000 years ago.”Ubisoft’s “Assassin’s Creed Origins” and “Assassin’s Creed Odyssey” already both offer convincing, well-researched facsimiles of life over 2,000 years ago in their historical tour features. Both games allow players to freely roam through meticulously designed representations of ancient Egypt and Greece, including standing in marketplaces, watching iconic monuments being built and ev",Much of what Zuckerberg promised about the metaverse exists today in video games.

It is an area we call … Meta, the new rebranded name of the Facebook parent company. Here are a few tales from this place.Nightmare of 40,000 Employees: A Facebook engineer has been hired to help protect the social network’s users. He notices a hideous flaw in the algorithm that is turning average middle-aged users into wild-eyed lurkers on the extreme wing of their political party. He keeps pointing this out to people in the company so that it can be fixed, but everyone silences or ignores him. Eventually he becomes convinced that he must be the problem and quits.Long Live Walter Jameson: Horrified by findings that their users are aging more rapidly than the population at large, Facebook employees try everything they can to turn back the clock, including but not limited to studying preteens and ""exploring playdates as a growth lever” for Facebook Messenger Kids. But nothing can stop the terrifying march of time, and Facebook ends the episode looking on in horror as its average user, Walter Jameson, ages suddenly and rapidly shrivels into dust after logging on one time too many.It’s a Good Meta-Life: There is a little boy (he is 37, but that does not stop people from referring to him as a little boy) who does not ever like even for a moment to hear dissent or complaints. He runs a major company, and gradually all the people there who questioned his judgment vanish. It is unclear to where. Myspace? A cornfield? Either way, none of them is ever heard from again, and the company is not better for it. Everyone around him is very happy and thinks his new metaverse is a good idea.Five Avatars in Search of an Exit: You are stuck in the metaverse with a robot, a clown, an artist and two of your co-workers. The metaverse just looks like your conference room, and you don’t understand why it was so important for you to be there or how exactly you got there. It is not fun, and it gives you a headache. As it turns out, you are all in a garbage can.The Howling Man: Facebook figures out that its new algorithm that attempts to decrease the spread of misinformation by lowering the sharing of articles that sharers have not actually read would have a disproportionally negative impact on articles from conservative sources … but it feels sorry for the articles that would be imprisoned by this new policy and doesn’t implement it. The articles get out.The Vaccines Are Not Wanted on Maple Street: A pandemic is sweeping the land, and people are getting their information about it on Facebook. Now they have become a paranoid mob!Time Enough at Last: When he gets around to it, Henry Bemis is going to finally read all the articles in his news feed and see what he thinks about them. But he never gets around to it; instead, he becomes radicalized and joins Oath Keepers.The Mirror: Believing that they can use Facebook to see who is betraying the state, the leaders in Vietnam ask Mark Zuckerberg to censor the content that appears on it. He agrees!I of the Beholder: A teenager with a normal self-image and good mental health joins Instagram. Her normal self-image doesn’t last long.To Serve Man: Mark Zuckerberg announces that he is going to create a wonderful network that will serve mankind, but actually, he means “serve” like “cook.""Last Night of a Keyboard Jockey: A young man makes a wish: to create a network that will connect the world and make everyone’s lives better, or maybe to effectively rate the attractiveness of girls. Because he is not clear in his mind about which one is his actual wish, he gets neither, instead creating a network that is full of misinformed, angry users and has been implicated in genocide and violence all around the world.

Redacted versions were reviewed by a consortium of news organizations, including The Washington Post, which obtained additional internal documents and conducted interviews with dozens of current and former Facebook employees.The company’s stock fell sharply after the revelations. Within roughly a month, they shed $54.08 apiece, Yost’s office said in a news release, “causing OPERS and other Facebook investors to lose more than $100 billion.”The company’s stock has since recovered from those late October lows, when shares traded near $312. They closed Tuesday at $342.96, which is nearly 10 percent off the record high it reached in September.A whistleblower’s power: Key takeaways from the Facebook PapersThe lawsuit is seeking more than $100 billion in damages and calling on the company to make “significant reforms” to ensure more transparency about its internal practices.The lawsuit alleges the company violated federal securities laws by misleading the public about how its algorithms affect minors in an effort to boost stock prices. It was filed in U.S. District Court of Northern California, where Meta has its headquarters.Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group, said investors and pension funds could present serious challenges for the company if they seek redress in light of Haugen’s revelations. He also said Zuckerberg’s tenure as chief executive could now be in play, because questions about his ability to manage the company in a trustworthy manner are now a focus of litigation against the company.“Until now, [Meta] has been able to either quash calls for regulation or hasn’t experienced serious economic damage due to its bad behavior (such as the $5b FTC fine),” Chester said in an email. “But with growing calls for the SEC to act, as well as what will be a wave of lawsuits focused on the company’s financial improprieties, there are likely to be consequences.”The $5 billion refers to a 2019 settlement the company reached with the Federal Trade Commission after a series of massive privacy mishaps.Meanwhile, the company is still responding to an antitrust lawsuit by the regulator that, if successful in court, could force Meta sell acquisitions that have been key to its success, including its WhatsApp and Instagram platforms. The agency has argued that Facebook sought to neutralize nascent competitors by gobbling them up through an “anticompetitive acquisition strategy.”In early November, the company said it would end its use of facial recognition software. The move comes after it agreed to pay $650 million to resolve a privacy lawsuit that alleged it used photo face-tagging and other biometric data without the permission of its users.",Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System and other investors.

CNN,Meta,1,Facebook changes its company name to Meta,https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/28/tech/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-keynote-announcements/index.html?utm_content=2021-10-28T18%3A35%3A03&utm_source=twCNN&utm_medium=social&utm_term=link,"Facebook is changing its company name as it shifts its focus to the ""metaverse"" and confronts wide-ranging scrutiny of the real-world harms from its various platforms after a whistleblower leaked hundreds of internal documents.Founder Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday that Facebook will change its corporate name to Meta, effectively demoting Facebook's namesake service to being just one of the company's subsidiaries, alongside Instagram and WhatsApp, rather than the overarching brand.The company formerly known as Facebook also said in a press release that it plans to begin trading under the stock ticker ""MVRS"" on December 1.A rebranding could be part of an effort to overhaul Facebook's reputation and turn the page following a series of PR nightmares, including misinformation on its platforms, content moderation failures and revelations about the negative effect its products have on some users' mental health.The name change, which was announced by Zuckerberg during the company's virtual reality and augmented reality conference Facebook Connect, aligns with its growing focus on the metaverse, which refers to efforts to combine virtual and augmented reality technologies in a new online realm. ""I've been thinking a lot about our identity as we begin this next chapter. Facebook is one of the most used products in the history of the world,"" Zuckerberg said on Thursday. ""It is an iconic social media brand, but increasingly it just doesn't encompass everything that we do.""Today we're seen as a social media company,"" he added, ""but in our DNA, we are a company that builds technology to connect people. And the metaverse is the next frontier just like social networking was when we got started.""Zuckerberg, who said he loved studying classics in school, said the name was inspired by the Greek word meta, which means ""beyond."" ""For me, it symbolizes that there is always more to build.""The company also replaced its corporate sign, which featured a picture of a ""thumbs up,"" outside of its California, headquarters with one touting its new logo: a blue infinity sign.Earlier this week, the company said that it would break out Facebook Reality Labs — its division dedicated to augmented and virtual reality services — as a separate reporting segment from its social apps. The change is set to take effect beginning in the fourth quarter.Facebook did not announce any executive changes on Thursday. But on Zuckerberg's personal Facebook page, his job title was changed to: ""Founder and CEO at Meta."" When asked by The Verge if he would remain CEO at Facebook in the next 5 years, he said: ""Probably. I don't have a specific date how long I want to be doing this for. I guess what I could say is I'm very excited about the next chapter of what we're doing.""Zuckerberg kicked off the big product event by teasing a series of new social, gaming and workplace concepts for the metaverse -- and by acknowledging the optics of focusing on such products amid renewed scrutiny of the company.""I know that some people will say that this isn't a time to focus on the future, and I want to acknowledge that there are important issues to work on in the present. There always will be,"" Zuckerberg said. ""So for many people, I'm just not sure there ever will be a good time to focus on the future. But I also know that there are a lot of you who feel the same way that I do."" ""We live for what we're building,"" Zuckerberg added. ""And while we make mistakes, we keep learning and building and moving forward.""Facebook showed a series of concept videos that highlighted its vision for metaverse, such as sending a holographic image of yourself to a concert with a friend attending in real life, sitting around virtual meeting tables with remote colleagues or playing immersive games with friends. Facebook recently said it would hire 10,000 people in Europe to build out the concept.Zuckerberg also announced Messenger calling is coming to VR, plans to operate a virtual marketplace where developers can sell virtual goods and a new home screen in Oculus Quest to make chatting and games in the virtual world more social.""Your devices won't be the focal point of your attention anymore,"" he said. ""We're starting to see a lot of these technologies coming together in the next five or 10 years. A lot of this is going to be mainstream and a lot of us will be creating and inhabiting worlds that are just as detailed and convincing as this one, on a daily basis.""A number of major companies have changed established brands over the years. Kentucky Fried Chicken shortened its name to KFC, Japanese car brand Datsun became Nissan. Some high-profile name changes have followed scandal or controversy. Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro, changed its name to Altria, for example, and ValuJet became AirTran after one of its planes crashed in 1996.Other name changes are intended to reflect the company's broader ambitions. Snapchat rebranded as Snap in 2016 to reflect its foray into hardware and Google rest","Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook will change its corporate name to Meta.

A profound reversal of the relationship between human beings and technology, a flipping of the real and virtual.Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookI'm speaking of the project Mark Zuckerberg launched on Thursday. It was the metaverse, he said, and also announced that his company's name had changed, to Meta, from Facebook. When I clicked on the link to Zuckerberg's video announcement, I thought it was a joke at first, maybe a ""deep fake."" Someone seemed to have modeled Zuckerberg's face and gestures pretty well, but the guy in the video was so robotic, surely he must have been an avatar. But no, this was the real Facebook founder, joining his most trusted employees in pitching the metaverse, Facebook's proprietary new virtual world of worlds where we are supposed to do our working, playing and socializing forever more. This isn't intended to be some casual digital simulation we enter and leave at will. Zuckerberg wants the metaverse to ultimately encompass the rest of our reality -- connecting bits of real space here to real space there, while totally subsuming what we think of as the real world. In the virtual and augmented future Facebook has planned for us, it's not that Zuckerberg's simulations will rise to the level of reality, it's that our behaviors and interactions will become so standardized and mechanical that it won't even matter. Instead of making human facial expressions, our avatars can make iconic thumbs-up gestures. Instead of sharing air and space together, we can collaborate on a digital document. We learn to downgrade our experience of being together with another human being to seeing their projection overlaid into the room like an augmented reality Pokemon figure. The less like humans and more like robots we can be, the more at home in the metaverse we will feel. In short, instead of making technology more compatible with human beings, these services and experiences slowly make human beings more compatible with technology. In the past, on platforms like Facebook and Instagram, this has meant learning to value fame more than connection, likes more than love, and sensation over meaning. Dutifully, teens sacrifice their mental health for image scrolling, and our politicians surrender governance for incitement. Yes, we could conclude that our world is pretty accurately depicted in social media at this point, but that is only because our society has lowered itself to the level of these platforms. Now, just as we're waking up to ways Facebook has knowingly eroded our social, mental and civic well-being, Zuckerberg is back with a new offering: a way out. Instead of struggling to make sense of or peace in the real world, we can surrender. We can slip on a pair of VR glasses and step out into the metaverse he is building for us. That's the whole function of the word ""meta."" Back when they taught us postmodernism in college, I remember getting stuck on that word. It's what all those French philosophers were trying to do to one another and the world around them. By coming up with a ""frame"" around someone else's work, they could in effect ""go meta"" on them. It's like when Beavis and Butt-Head -- animated characters on MTV -- comment on MTV's rock videos, or when Bo Burnham pulls the camera back to reveal we're just watching a television set with another instance of Bo. They've gone ""meta"" by stepping outside one world into the larger, embracing one. Meta does that, first and foremost, by becoming the ""holding company"" for all of Facebook's properties - Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Oculus -- as well as Facebook itself. Meta is not really a tech company so much as a conglomerate that buys and sells tech companies. A meta company. But on another level, Meta is the ultimate strategy for Facebook to get out of its many troubles.  Facebook is not cool with kids, it's in trouble with the government and its growth prospects are quite limited compared with Google, Apple and Amazon, which all develop different technologies like AI and robots and cloud services. Going meta is Facebook's escape hatch; it's Zuckerberg's way of telling us (and his investors) to forget about all the destruction his platforms have caused, and instead to look at the big picture.But if you look hard enough, you'll see it's not a big picture at all. It's a tiny network of virtual worlds, connected by a business plan that always leaves its users with less than they started with. No, to get through the portal to Facebook's metaverse, to go in the direction that Zuckerberg is pushing us, we must leave our humanity behind.

CNN,Meta,3,Facebook-parent Meta will remove the ability to target ads based on sensitive categories,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/09/tech/meta-facebook-ad-targeting-change/index.html?utm_source=twCNN&utm_medium=social&utm_term=link&utm_content=2021-11-10T06%3A31%3A01,"Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, said Tuesday it plans to limit advertisers' ability to target users based on certain sensitive categories. Starting next year, it will remove thousands of ""Detailed Targeting"" keywords to target ads to specific users in categories such as health, race or ethnicity, political affiliation, religion and sexual orientation.  Targeted advertising has long been central to the company's massive digital ads business. But for years, Facebook has faced criticism for allowing highly specific targeting that could, for example, allow advertisers to direct racist ads to users based on their activity on its platforms. In 2019, Facebook settled several lawsuits that alleged its advertising platform allowed for discrimination in housing, employment and credit ads. As part of the settlement, it set up a new portal for such ads. Tuesday's announcement marks the broadest action the company has taken yet to address concerns related to ad targeting.  In a blog post Tuesday, Meta (FB) vice president of product marketing for ads Graham Mudd said the move is a ""difficult decision"" made to ""better match people's evolving expectations of how advertisers may reach them on our platform and address feedback from civil rights experts, policymakers and other stakeholders on the importance of preventing advertisers from abusing the targeting options we make available.""  The announcement comes as the company faces scrutiny over the real-world harms caused by its platforms that were revealed in the ""Facebook Papers,"" a trove of internal documents offering unprecedented insight into some of the company's biggest problems. The documents were provided to lawmakers by former employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen, and obtained by dozens of news organizations, including CNN. In an announcement that coincided with its scramble to contain the fallout from the Facebook Papers, the company announced last month that it would change its name to Meta. It also said last week it will stop using facial-recognition software that could automatically recognize people in photos and videos on its Facebook app (although the company may still use such software in other products now and in the future).  Even after Tuesday's announcement, there will still be thousands of other detailed targeting categories that are not considered sensitive, such as users who are interested in football or more general categories like age, gender and location, that advertisers will still be able to use. That leaves open the possibility of tangential terms being used to target the same audiences they previously reached using sensitive keywords. ""We strongly believe that the best advertising experiences are personalized,"" Mudd said. He added that advertisers will have other options for targeting users, such as directing ads to people who have engaged with their pages or videos.  The change will apply globally to the Facebook, Instagram and Messenger apps, as well as Meta's ""audience network,"" through which it places ads on third-party apps. It will start rolling out on January 19, 2022, when advertisers will no longer be able to select keywords from sensitive categories for new ad campaigns, and in March, existing campaigns reliant on such keywords will no longer function, according to the company. The company places users in the categories based on their interactions on the platform, such as which pages they like and which ads they click on. Targeting keywords that will now be removed include terms like ""Catholic church"" and ""chemotherapy.""  Meta also said it plans to give users greater control over what kinds of ads they see.  ""Today, people can opt to see fewer ads related to politics, parenting, alcohol and pets,"" Mudd said. ""Early next year, we will be giving people control of more types of ad content, including gambling and weight loss, among others.""  While the ad targeting changes will apply to Meta's existing products, it's not clear whether the company will apply the same rules to future platforms as it pursues its ambitious plan to build the ""metaverse,"" a new, immersive version of the internet using VR and AR technologies.  ","Starting next year, Facebook will remove thousands of ""Detailed Targeting"" keywords. The move is a ""difficult decision"" made to ""better",That is a total lie.

The securities lawsuit, filed on behalf of the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System and other investors, alleges that the company misled the public about its algorithm and the harms the company's own research showed its apps can cause to users. It claims that Facebook-turned-Meta executives violated securities law by making false statements about the ""safety, security and privacy of its platforms"" in order to boost its stock. Meta (FB) shares have fallen around 7% since reporting on Haugen's claims and the internal documents began two months ago, harming investors to the tune of more than $100 billion, according to the lawsuit.""[Meta] repeatedly misrepresented to investors and the public that use of Facebook's products does not harm children, that the Company takes aggressive and effective measures to stop the spread of harmful content, and that Facebook applies its standards of behavior equally to all users,"" the lawsuit alleges.  ""Facebook investors recently learned the truth when former Facebook employee turned whistleblower, Frances Haugen, came forward with internal documents showing that Defendants were aware that Facebook's platforms facilitate dissention, illegal activity, and violent extremism, and cause significant harm to users,"" the complaint states. It lists the company, as well as CEO Mark Zuckerberg, CFO David Wehner and vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg as defendants. ""This suit is without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously,"" Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN Business Monday.The Wall Street Journal in September began publishing a series called the ""Facebook Files"" based on the internal documents, which raised concerns about Instagram's effects on teen girls, among other issues. The reporting prompted a Senate subcommittee hearing with Facebook head of global safety Antigone Davis. Haugen then testified before the Senate subcommittee, during which she said she believes that ""Facebook's products harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy.""  The internal documents, which have come to be known as the ""Facebook Papers,"" were provided by Haugen to the Securities and Exchange Commission and lawmakers. A consortium of news organizations, including CNN, reviewed the redacted versions received by Congress. The documents provide the deepest look yet at many of Meta's biggest problems, including with its approach to combating hate speech and misinformation, managing international growth and protecting younger users on its platform. Last month, another former Facebook employee anonymously filed a complaint against the company to the SEC, with allegations similar to Haugen's. The Ohio lawsuit, which was filed Friday, alleges that ""these disclosures erased more than $100 billion in shareholder value and subjected Facebook to immense reputational harm."" Meta (FB) has repeatedly refuted Haugen's claims and said the documents misrepresent the company's research and its actions.""At the heart of these stories is a premise which is false,"" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to CNN about the Facebook Papers last month. ""Yes, we're a business and we make profit, but the idea that we do so at the expense of people's safety or wellbeing misunderstands where our own commercial interests lie.""In the wake of reporting on the Facebook Papers, the company announced it was changing its name to Meta, a nod to its ambitious plans to build an immersive internet platform called the metaverse. It also made changes to its ad-targeting practices and how it's using facial-recognition software.  Still, members of Congress have since called for Zuckerberg to testify about the documents' findings.Yost's office said in a statement Monday that his lawsuit ""not only seeks to recover that lost value but also demands that Facebook make significant reforms to ensure it does not mislead the public about its internal practices.""

But investors looking to cash in on the virtual world known as the metaverse already have plenty of other options besides Mark Zuckerberg's social media giant. Gaming platform Roblox, which lets users generate their own avatars and play games created by other players, is arguably the most high-profile metaverse stock. Shares of the company have soared almost 160% since it listed directly on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year. And with a market cap of nearly $65 billion, Roblox is now worth more than established video game giants Electronic Arts (EA) and scandal-ridden Activision Blizzard (ATVI).Gaming software firm Unity Software, another metaverse player, just reported impressive earnings and the stock rose on the news. Unity also recently announced plans to acquire technology firm Weta Digital, a visual effects studio founded by ""The Lord of the Rings"" director Peter Jackson, for more than $1.6 billion  to further enhance its metaverse offerings. Companies ranging from Playboy owner PLBY Group and body camera maker Axon (AAXN) to record label Warner Music Group and media giant Disney (DIS) all discussed the metaverse in earnings calls during the past few weeks. PLBY mentioned the possibility of virtual parties with ""Rabbitars"" at a metaverse Playboy mansion, for example, while Axon talked about the growing threat of fraud, theft and other digital crime in virtual worlds.""The metaverse is at the cusp of drastically changing the gaming industry, and eventually others,"" said analysts at Manhattan Venture Research in a recent report.  Chip giants such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) are poised to make money from the metaverse too, as their 5G chips and graphics processors will help power the increased push into virtual worlds. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said during an investor presentation Tuesday that the company wants to be ""the ticket to the metaverse."" There's even a metaverse ETF (trading under the ticker symbol META) that holds Roblox and Unity as well as Nvidia and Qualcomm, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and, yes, Meta Platforms. The Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF has surged more than 13% in the past month, topping the broader market — and Meta Platforms — during the same time frame.Still, even though Facebook isn't the first company to embrace the metaverse, one analyst says that the platform's recent pivot to virtual worlds is probably a big reason why the metaverse has gotten so much more attention lately.""The Facebook rebrand has brought the metaverse concept to a wider audience,"" Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said in a report.

CNN,Meta,6,State attorneys general launch investigation into Meta-owned Instagram's impact on kids,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/18/tech/meta-instagram-kids-attorneys-general-investigation/index.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twCNN&utm_term=link&utm_content=2021-11-19T02%3A20%3A33,"A bipartisan group of 10 state attorneys general have launched an investigation into Meta, the social media company formerly known as Facebook, focused on the potential harms of its Instagram platform on children and teens.  The announcement follows extensive reporting on a trove of internal documents leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Some of those documents show that the company's own researchers have found that Instagram can damage young users' mental health and body image, and can exacerbate dangerous behaviors such as eating disorders.  The attorneys general say they will look into whether, by continuing to provide and promote Instagram despite knowing of the potential harms, Meta violated consumer protection laws and ""put the public at risk."" The states involved include California, Florida, Kentucky and Vermont. ""Facebook, now Meta, has failed to protect young people on its platforms and instead chose to ignore or, in some cases, double down on known manipulations that pose a real threat to physical and mental health -- exploiting children in the interest of profit,"" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is co-leading the investigation, said in a statement. She added that the coalition hopes to ""get to the bottom of this company's engagement with young users, identify any unlawful practices, and end these abuses for good."" Meta (FB) spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement that the allegations made by the attorneys general are false and said they ""demonstrate a deep misunderstanding of the facts."" He also noted that the company plans to launch features to help teens regulate their use of Instagram, such as a ""Take a Break"" reminder, which was announced in October amid intense scrutiny.  ""While challenges in protecting young people online impact the entire industry, we've led the industry in combating bullying and supporting people struggling with suicidal thoughts, self-injury, and eating disorders,"" the statement reads. ""We continue to develop parental supervision controls and are exploring ways to provide even more age-appropriate experiences for teens by default."" The investigation is the latest escalation of regulatory pressure on Meta related to findings from the leaked internal documents, which have come to be known as the Facebook Papers. Earlier this week, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit against the company alleging that it misled the public about its algorithm and the harms its apps can cause to users, causing losses for shareholders when those things were revealed. (Meta says the suit is without merit.) Senator Richard Blumenthal has also asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about the effects of Instagram on children. The Wall Street Journal first reported in September on what the company's own documents and research show about the potential harms to young people from its apps, and said Facebook knew Instagram was ""toxic"" for teen girls. In one internal report from 2019 on the mental health effects of Instagram cited by the Journal and reviewed by CNN Business, company researchers said ""we make body image issues worse for 1 in 3 teen girls."" Meta has also pushed back on the Journal's reporting, and said its apps do more good than harm.  Following the Journal's report, a Senate subcommittee called a hearing with Facebook head of global safety Antigone Davis, where lawmakers grilled her on Instagram's effects on kids. Davis said the company was ""looking for ways to release more research"" that she suggested might paint a different picture about the platform. Haugen has also testified to lawmakers that she believes Meta's platforms ""harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy.""  The company announced it was pausing plans to develop a version of Instagram designed for kids in late September, amid the fallout from the Journal report.  ""While we stand by the need to develop this experience, we've decided to pause this project,"" Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, wrote in a blog post at the time. ""This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today.""

CNN,Meta,7,Meta ordered to sell Giphy by UK antitrust authorities,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/30/tech/meta-giphy-uk-cma/index.html?utm_term=link&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twCNN&utm_content=2021-11-30T10%3A30%3A09,"Regulators have long threatened to break up Facebook (now called Meta) because of its huge market power. Now one group of officials has followed through and ordered the company to unwind its acquisition of Giphy because the deal could hurt competitors. The UK Competition and Markets Authority said on Tuesday that Meta's control of the popular search engine for GIFs — short, looping videos and animations — would reduce competition between social media platforms and had already removed one potential rival in the advertising market. Facebook (FB) bought Giphy for $315 million in 2020. It was intending to integrate the service with Instagram, making it easier for people to find relevant GIFs for their stories and direct messages.Although far from the largest acqusition Meta has ever done, the Giphy acquisition is the company's first high-profile deal government officials have tried to reverse. The finding is a blow to Meta's aspirations amid intense antitrust scrutiny by governments around the world, and a potential red flag for other Big Tech companies pursuing acquisitions in this regulatory climate.In its initial announcement of the deal, Facebook had vowed to grant third parties the same level of access to Giphy's content as before. Less than a month after the acquisition was announced, however, the CMA said it was looking into it.""After consulting with interested businesses and organizations — and assessing alternative solutions ... put forward by Facebook — the CMA has concluded that its competition concerns can only be addressed by Facebook selling Giphy in its entirety to an approved buyer,"" the CMA said in a statement.The tech company said Tuesday it disagreed with the CMA and was considering ""all options, including appeal.""""Both consumers and Giphy are better off with the support of our infrastructure, talent, and resources,"" a Meta spokesperson said. ""Together, Meta and Giphy would enhance Giphy's product for the millions of people, businesses, developers and API partners in the UK and around the world who use Giphy every day, providing more choices for everyone.""In its initial report published in August, the regulator said that Facebook's control over Giphy could allow it to cut off other social media sites' access to GIFs. Giphy's services currently integrate with platforms such as Twitter (TWTR), Snapchat, Apple's (AAPL) iMessage and Slack (WORK).Detailing the reasons for its findings, the CMA said the acquisition of Giphy would boost Meta's significant market power. In addition to driving more traffic to its Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram platforms, it would allow the company to require competitors such as TikTok, Twitter and Snapchat (SNAP) to provide more user data to access GIFs.The CMA also found that, before the merger, Giphy had launched innovative advertising services which it was considering expanding to countries including the United Kingdom. Giphy allowed companies — such as Dunkin' Donuts and Pepsi (PEP) — to promote their brands through visual images and GIFs, and it could have competed with Facebook's own display advertising services. Facebook terminated Giphy's advertising services at the time of the merger, removing an important source of potential competition, the CMA said. ""The CMA considers this particularly concerning given that Facebook controls nearly half of the £7 billion [$9 billion] display advertising market  in the UK,"" it added. The dispute with UK authorities has already been costly for Meta. The CMA fined the company $70 million in October for repeatedly ignoring warnings and deliberately breaking its rules.The CMA said that Facebook had ""consciously"" refused to report all the required information during the Giphy investigation.",Facebook bought Giphy for $315 million in 2020.

Reuters,Meta,1,"Facebook announced it would rebrand as Meta, a name change that underscores its ambitions to refocus the world's largest social network on building the ‘metaverse’",https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebooks-zuckerberg-kicks-off-its-virtual-reality-event-with-metaverse-vision-2021-10-28/,"Facebook Inc (FB.O) is now called Meta, the company said on Thursday, in a rebrand that focuses on building the ""metaverse,"" a shared virtual environment that it bets will be the successor to the mobile internet.The name change comes as the world's largest social media company battles criticisms from lawmakers and regulators over its market power, algorithmic decisions and the policing of abuses on its services.CEO Mark Zuckerberg, speaking at the company's live-streamed virtual and augmented reality conference, said the new name reflected its work investing in the metaverse, rather than its namesake social media service, which will continue to be called Facebook.The metaverse is a term coined in the dystopian novel ""Snow Crash"" three decades ago and now attracting buzz in Silicon Valley. It refers broadly to the idea of a shared virtual realm which can be accessed by people using different devices.""Right now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can't possibly represent everything that we're doing today, let alone in the future,"" said Zuckerberg.The company, which has invested heavily in augmented and virtual reality, said the change would bring together its different apps and technologies under one new brand. It said it would not change its corporate structure.The tech giant, which reports about 2.9 billion monthly users, has faced increasing scrutiny in recent years from global lawmakers and regulators.In the latest controversy, whistleblower and former Facebook employee Frances Haugen leaked documents which she said showed the company chose profit over user safety. Haugen has in recent weeks testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee and lawmakers in the UK's Parliament. Zuckerberg earlier this week said the documents were being used to paint a ""false picture.""The company said in a blog post that it intends to start trading under the new stock ticker it has reserved, MVRS, on Dec. 1. On Thursday, it unveiled a new sign at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, replacing its thumbs-up ""Like"" logo with a blue infinity shape.Facebook shares closed 1.5% higher at $316.92 on Thursday.TARNISHED REPUTATIONFacebook said this week that its hardware division Facebook Reality Labs, which is responsible for AR and VR efforts, would become a separate reporting unit and that its investment in it would reduce this year's total operating profit by about $10 billion.People pose for a photo in front of a sign of Meta, the new name for the company formerly known as Facebook, at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S. October 28, 2021. REUTERS/Nathan FrandinoThis year, the company created a product team in this unit focused on the metaverse and it recently announced plans to hire 10,000 employees in Europe over the next five years to work on the effort.In an interview with tech publication the Information, Zuckerberg said he has not considered stepping down as CEO, and has not thought ""very seriously yet"" about spinning off this unit.The division will now be called Reality Labs, its head Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth said on Thursday. The company will also stop using the Oculus branding for its VR headsets, instead calling them ""Meta"" products.The name change, the plan for which was first reported by the Verge, is a significant rebrand for Facebook, but not its first. In 2019 it launched a new logo to create a distinction between the company and its social app.The company's reputation has taken multiple hits in recent years, including over its handling of user data and its policing of abuses such as health misinformation, violent rhetoric and hate speech. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has also filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices.""While it'll help alleviate confusion by distinguishing Facebook's parent company from its founding app, a name change doesn't suddenly erase the systemic issues plaguing the company,"" said Mike Proulx, research director at market research firm Forrester.The plans to phase out the Facebook name even from products like video calling device Portal show the company is eager to prevent the unprecedented scrutiny from hurting the rest of its apps, said Prashant Malaviya, a marketing professor at Georgetown University McDonough School of Business. ""Without a doubt, (the Facebook name) is definitely damaged and toxic,"" he said.Zuckerberg said the new name, coming from the Greek word for ""beyond,"" symbolized there was always more to build. Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) CEO Jack Dorsey on Thursday tweeted out a different definition ""referring to itself or to the conventions of its genre; self-referential.""Zuckerberg said the new name also reflects that over time, users will not need to use Facebook to use the company's other services.In 2015, Google reorganized to create a new holding company called Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), as the popular search engine broke into new fields such as self-driving cars, high-speed broadband and expanded its cloud business.

Anyone can read what you share.By Steven Lee MyersPeng Shuai, the professional tennis star, publicly accused a former vice premier of China of sexual assault, igniting an online firestorm of attention to a #MeToo allegation that for the first time touched the pinnacles of Communist Party power.Ms. Peng made the accusation in a post on Tuesday night on her verified account on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. In it, she described an assault by Zhang Gaoli, who from 2012 to 2017 served on the party’s Politburo Standing Committee, the top ruling body in China. She also described having had an on-and-off consensual relationship with Mr. Zhang.The post was removed within minutes, but the allegations swirled through the country’s heavily controlled internet, fueled by the fame of the accuser and the accused. That kept the censors inside China’s Great Firewall scrambling.Searches of her name and even the word “tennis” appeared to be blocked, reflecting the extraordinary sensitivity within China of discussing misconduct by party leaders.“The impact of #MeToo has been accumulating for three years,” Lü Pin, an activist who founded the now-banned Chinese online forum Feminist Voices, said in a telephone interview from New Jersey, where she now lives. “When the first women began talking about their experiences three years ago, no one could have imagined that it would reach this high level.”Ms. Peng’s accusations could not be corroborated. In her post, she acknowledged that she would be unable to produce evidence of her accusation, suggesting at one point that Mr. Zhang had expressed worries that she might record their encounters.She could not be reached for comment. The State Council, China’s governing body, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The authorities have charged government officials with sexual misconduct before, often in conjunction with corruption investigations. Never before, though, has an accusation of sexual misconduct been leveled publicly against as senior a political leader as Mr. Zhang.“These allegations are not shocking in substance but are shocking in the target,” Bill Bishop, the founder of Sinocism, a newsletter on Chinese affairs, wrote.An economist by education, Mr. Zhang, now 75, rose through the ranks of the party and government. He served as governor of Shandong, the coastal province, and then as party secretary in Tianjin, the provincial-level port city on the Bohai Sea. As vice premier from 2013 to 2018, he was one of seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee, headed then, as now, by China’s leader, Xi Jinping.“I know that for someone of your eminence, Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, you’ve said that you’re not afraid,” Ms. Peng wrote in her post, “but even if it’s just me, like an egg hitting a rock, or a moth to the flame, courting self-destruction, I’ll tell the truth about you.”Women in media, at universities and in the private sector in China have all come forward with accusations of sexual assault and harassment — only to face pushback in the courts and censorship online.In China, many women say, there remains an ingrained patriarchal tradition of using positions in business or government to gain sexual favors from subordinates or other women. In 2016, the country’s top prosecuting agency listed the exchange of “power for sex recklessly” as one of six traits of senior officials accused of corruption.The accuser in another high-profile harassment case, Zhou Xiaoxuan, posted a note expressing sympathy for Ms. Peng, illustrating how widely the accusation became known despite the censorship. “I hope she’s safe and sound,” she wrote.Where is Peng Shuai? The Chinese tennis star disappeared from public view for weeks after she accused a top Chinese leader of sexual assault. Recent videos that appear to show Ms. Peng have done little to resolve concerns for her safety.Who is Peng Shuai? Ms. Peng, 35, is a three-time Olympian whose career began more than two decades ago. In 2014, she rose to become ranked No. 1 in doubles in the world, the first Chinese player, male or female, to attain the top rank in either singles or doubles tennis.Why did she disappear? On Nov. 2, Ms. Peng posted a long note on the Chinese social platform Weibo that accused Zhang Gaoli, 75, a former vice premier, of sexual assault. Within minutes, censors scrubbed her account and a digital blackout on her accusations has been in place ever since.How has the world responded? The censors might have succeeded had Steve Simon, the head of the Women’s Tennis Association, not spoken out on Nov. 14.

Anyone can read what you share.By Alexandra Stevenson and Steven Lee MyersFirst came the shocking #MeToo accusation by a famous athlete against one of China’s top leaders. Then came the accuser’s disappearance from public view, one so thorough that questions swirled about her health and personal safety.The authorities in China had hoped the apparatus of a repressive state could simply make the whole thing go away. Instead, an accusation by the tennis player Peng Shuai that she was sexually assaulted by a former vice premier, Zhang Gaoli, continues to confront the political establishment as few things have.The latest pushback on China’s effort to squelch the accusation came early on Thursday after Chinese state media tried to refute it, while saying Ms. Peng was safe and sound. It published an email purportedly written by Ms. Peng herself, saying the sexual assault accusations were not true and asking for officials who run women’s tennis to stop meddling.The response by the Women’s Tennis Association just hours later was unequivocal, suggesting that the email was very likely a crude fraud. “I have a hard time believing that Peng Shuai actually wrote the email we received or believes what is being attributed to her,” said Steve Simon, the association’s executive director.The international furor over Ms. Peng’s accusation has erupted only weeks before a major event on China’s calendar — the Winter Olympics in Beijing. The Chinese government now faces a new firestorm of criticism of its behavior, which has added fuel to calls for a diplomatic and commercial boycott of the Games.“The brazen efforts to silence Peng Shuai seem at odds with China’s focus on making the Beijing Olympics a success,” said Natasha Kassam, the director of public opinion and foreign policy at the Lowy Institute and a former diplomat in Beijing.“There’s little doubt that the fake statement will only strengthen calls to boycott the Olympics,” she said, adding that the handling of Ms. Peng’s accusation “cast even more shadow” on how the International Olympic Committee has responded to allegations that China is committing genocide against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.The committee has long taken a position that sports are separate from the politics of host countries, saying the focus should remain on the athletes and the events. But in China, as in many countries, sports and politics are inextricably intertwined.Ms. Peng’s case is the first #MeToo accusation leveled against someone within the highest ranks of power in China, the Politburo Standing Committee. It has highlighted the country’s swaggering confidence in its ability to suppress all criticism, including from women who have come forward with accusations of misconduct.“She is definitely not the first one to be forced into silence and disappeared,” Lü Pin, an activist who founded the now-banned Chinese online forum Feminist Voices, wrote in a message from New Jersey, where she now lives. “This kind of encounter is absolutely not uncommon in China now. The authorities have too much power and no one can hold them accountable.”What has elevated Ms. Peng’s case is her celebrity at home. As she skyrocketed through the ranks of professional tennis, she was once held up by the Chinese government as a model athlete. “She is like a breeze in women’s tennis,” the People’s Daily, the main newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, wrote in 2013. “She’ll always be our Chinese princess.”That was shortly after she and her doubles partner, Hsieh Su-wei of Taiwan, won the championship at Wimbledon. They won again at the French Open in 2014, the year she reached the semifinals of the U.S. Open as a singles player and was lauded by officials as a “golden flower” of Chinese sports.On Nov. 2, her accusation became a thorn in the government’s side.In a long, at times disjointed post published on her verified social media account that night, Ms. Peng described an on-and-off relationship with Mr. Zhang, a former provincial governor who served as one of seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee between 2012 and 2017. When he stepped down, her post said, they reunited and he assaulted her after inviting her to play tennis with him and his wife.Ms. Peng, 35, described feeling powerless in making accusations against such a politically powerful man. In the account, which has not been corroborated, Ms. Peng acknowledged that she could not provide evidence.The accusation reverberated, though, in a society where women are often mistreated. Her description of assault has hit a nerve in China’s nascent #MeToo movement, which has struggled to gain momentum as women who come forward as victims are frequently met with heavy-handed legal responses and censorship online.“Even if it’s just me, like an egg h",Tennis player Peng Shuai accused former vice premier Zhang Gaoli of sexually assaulting her.

The Women’s Tennis Association moved to suspend all tournaments in China.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Raymond ZhongA simple question has gripped the sports world and drawn the attention of the White House, United Nations and others:Where is Peng Shuai?The Chinese tennis star disappeared from public view for weeks in November after she accused a top Chinese leader of sexual assault, prompting a global chorus of concern for her safety. Then, the editor of a Communist Party-controlled newspaper posted video clips that appear to show Ms. Peng eating at a restaurant and attending a tennis event in Beijing. Days later, the International Olympic Committee said its president had spoken with her in a video call.But the Women’s Tennis Association said it remained concerned about Ms. Peng’s ability to communicate freely and reiterated calls for Beijing to investigate her accusations. China’s authoritarian government has a long record of iron-fisted treatment of people who threaten to undermine public confidence in the party’s senior leaders. On Dec. 1, the tennis association announced that it was immediately suspending all tournaments in China, including Hong Kong. The Biden administration and United Nations human rights office have joined the calls for Beijing to provide proof of Ms. Peng’s well-being.With only a few months to go before Beijing hosts the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, Ms. Peng’s situation could become another point of tension in China’s increasingly fractious relationship with the wider world.Peng Shuai, 35 — her family name is pronounced “pung,” and the end of her given name rhymes with “why” — is a three-time Olympian whose tennis career began more than two decades ago.In February 2014, after winning the doubles crown at Wimbledon with Hsieh Su-wei of Taiwan the year before, Ms. Peng rose to become a world No. 1 in doubles, the first Chinese player, male or female, to attain the top rank in either singles or doubles. She and Ms. Hsieh took the 2014 French Open doubles title as well.Her doubles career underwent a resurgence in 2016 and 2017. But in 2018, she was barred from professional play for six months, with a three-month suspension, after she was found to have tried to use “coercion” and financial incentives to change her Wimbledon doubles partner after the sign-in deadline. She has not competed professionally since early 2020.Late in the evening on Nov. 2, Ms. Peng posted a long note on the Chinese social platform Weibo that exploded across the Chinese internet.In the post, she accused Zhang Gaoli, 75, a former vice premier, of inviting her to his home about three years ago and coercing her into sex. “That afternoon, I didn’t consent at first,” she wrote. “I was crying the entire time.”She and Mr. Zhang began a consensual, if conflicted, relationship after that, she wrote. Within minutes, censors scrubbed Ms. Peng’s account from the Chinese internet. A near-blackout on her accusations has been in place ever since.Women in China who come forward as victims of sexual assault and predation have long been met with censorship and pushback. But Ms. Peng’s account, which has not been corroborated, is the first to implicate such a high-level Communist Party leader, which may be why the authorities have been extra diligent in silencing all discussion of the matter, at one point even blocking online searches for the word “tennis.” Zhang Gaoli had served from 2012 to 2017 on China’s top ruling body, the Politburo Standing Committee, making him one of the country’s most powerful men. Mr. Zhang had climbed steadily from running an oil refinery to a succession of leadership posts along China’s fast-growing coast, and had avoided the scandals and controversy that felled other, flashily ambitious politicians. He became known, if for anything, for his monotone impersonality. On entering China’s top leadership, he invited people to search for anything amiss in his behavior.“Stern, low-key, taciturn,” summed up one of the few profiles of him in the Chinese media. His interests, Xinhua news agency said, included books, chess and tennis.The censors might have succeeded had Steve Simon, the head of the Women’s Tennis Association, not spoken out on Nov. 14, calling on Beijing to investigate Ms. Peng’s accusations and stop trying to bury her case.On Dec. 1, the tennis association announced it was ending all tournaments in China, including Hong Kong. Mr. Simon cited concerns about Ms. Peng’s safety, and added in a statement that “unless China takes the steps we have asked for, we cannot put our players and staff at risk by holding events in China.” By pulling out of China, the tour stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming years.The International Olympic Committee said that it was engaging in",China's censorship of the tennis stars #MeToo allegations hasn't been able to silence a chorus of concern for her safety.

But she has been unable to break through China’s resistance to sexual assault allegations.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Alexandra Stevenson and Steven Lee MyersWhen Peng Shuai was a young tennis player in China’s national sports system, she battled officials for control over her own professional career — and she won.When she took on one of China’s most powerful men three weeks ago, accusing him of sexual assault, she found her voice silenced, erased from China’s heavily controlled cyberspace and smiling in awkward public appearances most likely intended to defuse what has become an international scandal.At 35, Ms. Peng is one of her country’s most recognized athletes, a doubles champion at Wimbledon and the French Open whom state media once hailed as “our Chinese princess.” If anyone were able to break through the country’s icy resistance to #MeToo allegations, it would seem to be someone like her.Instead, she has become another example of China’s iron grip over politics, society and sports, and an object lesson in the struggle facing women who dare to challenge Beijing — even those who have had a history of winning praise from the state.Her allegation was the first to penetrate the highest pinnacles of power in China, the Politburo Standing Committee. It was an act of courage and perhaps desperation that has resulted in an aggressive response, smothering her inside China.“Peng has always been a strong-minded person,” said Terry Rhoads, the managing director of Zou Sports, the talent management agency in Shanghai that represented her for a decade until 2014. “I witnessed up close her struggles and battles with people bossing her or having authority over her tennis.”Over the weekend, the state’s propaganda apparatus produced a series of photographs and videos purporting to show Ms. Peng carrying on as if nothing had happened.The only thing missing from the recent flurry of coverage was her own voice, one once strong enough to force the authorities to bend to her steely determination to control her own destiny.The images were in striking contrast to her own description three weeks ago of being like “a moth darting into the flames” in order to “tell the truth” about her relationship with — and mistreatment by — Zhang Gaoli, a former vice premier, who she said assaulted her around three years ago.“The authorities have never liked feminists or #MeToo,” said Lijia Zhang, the author of “Lotus,” a novel depicting prostitution in China. Those who “dared to speak out,” she added, “have been silenced.”A #WhereisPengShuai campaign has taken root less than three months before Beijing is to host the Winter Olympics, an event that the country’s leadership has indicated would validate Communist Party rule. The handling of Ms. Peng’s accusation has only inflamed criticism, giving ammunition to those who have called for a boycott.“These photos and videos can only prove that Peng Shuai is alive, but nothing else. They cannot prove that Peng Shuai is free,” Teng Biao, one of China’s most prominent civil rights lawyers, said in a telephone call from his home in New Jersey.Ms. Peng spoke on Sunday with officials at the International Olympic Committee, which passed on a message from her saying “that she is safe and well” but that she “would like to have her privacy respected at this time.” That didn’t satisfy Steve Simon, the chief executive of the WTA Tour, which has been pressing for answers about Ms. Peng’s ability to move and speak freely. “It was good to see Peng Shuai in recent videos, but they don’t alleviate or address the WTA’s concern about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion,” the group said in a statement.Women in China have long struggled to have agency in the country, a situation that many activists say has worsened since Mr. Xi came to power nearly a decade ago.Ms. Peng carved out a professional tennis career that meant taking on officials who tried to dictate whom she could train with, what tournaments she could play in and how much money she could keep for herself.When it comes to an accusation of sexual misconduct, however, the state has proved to be more resistant to change. The moment Ms. Peng posted her #MeToo allegations, Mr. Teng said, “she was barely protected by the law, and it was all politics that determined her fate.”Born in the city of Xiangtan, where her father was a police officer, Ms. Peng was introduced to tennis by an uncle when she was 8. At 12, she required surgery to correct a congenital heart defect that left people doubting she could continue to play.“They thought I would leave tennis,” she said in an Adidas ad campaign in 2008, “but surprisingly, I didn’t give up. Maybe because I love tennis so much I decided to have this operation.”After the surgery, she was sent to Tianjin, where she was dr",The tennis player won independence while remaining in Beijings good graces.

Anyone can read what you share.By Li YuanThe Chinese government has become extremely effective in controlling what the country’s 1.4 billion people think and talk about.But influencing the rest of the world is a different matter, as Peng Shuai has aptly demonstrated.Chinese state media and its journalists have offered one piece of evidence after another to prove the star Chinese tennis player was safe and sound despite her public accusation of sexual assault against a powerful former vice premier.One Beijing-controlled outlet claimed it had obtained an email she wrote in which she denied the accusations. Another offered up a video of Ms. Peng at a dinner, in which she and her companions rather conspicuously discussed the date to prove that it was recorded this past weekend.The international outcry grew only louder. Instead of persuading the world, China’s ham-handed response has become a textbook example of its inability to communicate with an audience that it can’t control through censorship and coercion.The ruling Communist Party communicates through one-way, top-down messaging. It seems to have a hard time understanding that persuasive narratives must be backed by facts and verified by credible, independent sources.In its official comments, China’s foreign ministry has mostly dodged questions about Ms. Peng, claiming first to be unaware of the matter, then that the topic fell outside its purview. On Tuesday, Zhao Lijian, a spokesman, leaned on a familiar tactic: questioning the motives behind the coverage of Ms. Peng’s allegations. “I hope certain people will stop malicious hype, not to mention to politicize it,” he told reporters.China has grown more sophisticated in recent years at using the power of the internet to advance a more positive, less critical narrative — an effort that appears to work from time to time. But at its heart, China’s propaganda machine still believes the best way to make problems disappear is to shout down the other side. It can also threaten to close off access to its vast market and booming economy to silence companies and governments that don’t buy its line.“Messages like these are meant as a demonstration of power: ‘We are telling you that she is fine, and who are you to say otherwise?’” Mareike Ohlberg, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund, a research institute, wrote on Twitter. “It’s not meant to convince people but to intimidate and demonstrate the power of the state.”China has a history of less-than-believable testimonials. A jailed prominent lawyer denounced her son on state television for fleeing the country. A Hong Kong bookstore manager who was detained for selling books about the private lives of Chinese leaders said after his release that he had to make a dozen recorded confessions before his captors were satisfied.This time, the world of women’s tennis isn’t playing along and has suggested it will stop holding events in China until it is sure Ms. Peng is truly free of government control. The biggest names in tennis — Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka and Novak Djokovic, among many others — don’t seem to be afraid to lose access to a potential market of 1.4 billion tennis fans, either. The pushback is problematic because the Winter Olympics in Beijing are just weeks away from opening.The country’s huge army of propagandists has failed the expectations of its top leader, Xi Jinping, that it take control of the global narrative about China. But it shouldn’t take all the blame: The failure is ingrained in the controlling nature of China’s authoritarian system.“It can make Peng Shuai play any role, including putting up a show of being free,” Pin Ho, a New York-based media businessman, wrote on Twitter. For Chinese officials in charge of crisis management, he continued, such control is routine. “But for the free world,” he said, “this is even more frightening than forced confessions.”One of the biggest giveaways that Ms. Peng isn’t free to speak her mind is that her name remains censored on the Chinese internet.“As long as coverages about her inside and outside China are different, she’s not speaking freely,” said Rose Luqiu, an assistant professor of journalism at the Hong Kong Baptist University.Despite the outpouring of concern about Ms. Peng’s well-being on Twitter and other online platforms that are blocked in China, the Chinese public has little knowledge of the discussions.Late Friday, as the momentum of the hashtag #whereispengshuai was building on Twitter, I couldn’t find any discussion of the question on Chinese social media. Still, Ms. Peng had clearly caught the attention of politically observant Chinese.

Anyone can read what you share.By Andrew KehTo hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android.The rewards for international sports leagues and organizations are plain: lucrative broadcast deals, bountiful sponsorship opportunities, millions of new consumers.The risks are obvious, too: the compromising of values, the public relations nightmares, the general atmosphere of opacity.For years, they have surveyed the Chinese market, measured these factors and come up with the same basic math: that the benefits of doing business there outweighed the possible downsides. The N.B.A. might blunder into a humbling political crisis based on a single tweet, and rich contracts might vanish into thin air overnight, but China, the thinking went, was a potential gold mine. And for that reason leagues, teams, governing bodies and athletes contorted themselves for any chance to tap into it.But recent events may have changed that thinking for good, and raised a new question: Is doing business in China still worth it?The sports world received a hint last week of a changing dynamic when the WTA — one of many organizations that have worked aggressively over the last decade to establish a foothold in the Chinese market — threatened to stop doing business there altogether if the government failed to confirm the safety of Peng Shuai. Peng, a top women’s tennis player once hailed by state media as “our Chinese princess,” disappeared from public life recently after accusing a prominent former government official of sexual assault.The WTA’s threat was remarkable not only for its reasoning, but for its rarity.But as China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, governs through an increasingly authoritarian approach, and as its record on human rights has made the country, and those who do business there, a growing target for a chorus of critics and activists, sports leagues and organizations may soon be forced to re-evaluate their longstanding assumptions.That sort of direct confrontation is already taking place elsewhere: Lawmakers in the European Union recently called for stronger ties with Taiwan, an island China claims as its territory, only months after European officials blocked a landmark commercial agreement over human rights concerns and labeled China a “totalitarian threat.”For most sports organizations, the WTA’s position remains an outlier. Sports organizations with multimillion-dollar partnerships in China — whether the N.B.A., England’s Premier League, Formula 1 auto racing or the International Olympic Committee — have mostly brushed aside concerns.Some partners have acquiesced at times to China’s various demands. A few have issued humbling apologies. The I.O.C., in perhaps the most notable example, has seemed to go out of its way to avoid angering China, even as Peng, a three-time Olympian, went missing.But an evolving public opinion may get harder for sports organizations to ignore. A report this year from the Pew Research Center, for instance, found that 67 percent of Americans had negative feelings toward China, up from 46 percent in 2018. Similar shifts have occurred in other Western democracies.Mark Dreyer, a sports analyst for China Sports Insider, based in Beijing, said the WTA’s standoff with China represented an escalation in the “them or us” mentality that appeared to be forming between China and its Western rivals.The threat from the WTA, then, could serve as a sign of showdowns to come, in which case, Dreyer said, China could lose out.“Frankly, China is a big market, but the rest of the world is still bigger,” he said. “And if people have to choose, they’re not going to choose China.”To some experts, then, the WTA’s extraordinary decision to confront China head-on might actually signal a turning point rather than an aberration.“The calculation is one part political, one part moral, one part economic,” said Simon Chadwick, a professor of international sports business at Emlyon Business School in Lyon, France. He said that the WTA’s dispute with China reflected the “red line” growing between the country and many of its Western counterparts, with the sides seeming more entrenched in diverging sociopolitical ideologies.“I think we are rapidly heading toward the kind of terrain where organizations, businesses, and sponsors will be forced to choose one side or another,” Chadwick added.The WTA’s own about-face was stark. Only three years ago, the organization was heralding a deal that made Shenzhen, China, the new home of its tour finals for a decade starting in 2019, accepting promises of a new stadium and a whopping $14 million annual prize pool. In 2019, just before the pandemic, the WTA held nine tournaments in China.Fast forward to last week, when ",Global outrage over broken contracts and shifting politics could change the calculus for leagues and teams.

Anyone can read what you share.By Tariq Panja and Steven Lee MyersThe International Olympic Committee was under siege.Peng Shuai, a three-time Olympian from China, had not been heard from for weeks after making sexual abuse allegations against a senior political official, a man who had played a central role in preparations for the coming Winter Games in Beijing.Initially silent on the disappearance of Peng, a women’s tennis star, Olympic officials were now facing a growing global chorus of concern. The WTA Tour, through its chief executive, was demanding answers and an investigation. Fellow tennis stars like Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka — but also human rights groups, politicians and everyday fans — were using social media to ask #WhereIsPengShuai? Media organizations were flooding the internet with news coverage.Cornered by the criticism, the I.O.C. finally responded. This, Olympic officials insisted, was a time not for public statements but for “quiet diplomacy.”For the organization’s many critics, the guarded, cautious language — viewed more as an attempt to explain away its silence rather than ensure Peng’s safety — was just the latest proof that the I.O.C. will not take any action that might upset China’s government, its partner for a Winter Olympics that is now only months away.The response drew public condemnation and frustration behind the scenes in the Olympic movement.“The I.O.C. must not be complicit in protecting the regime and allowing it be captured for Chinese propaganda purposes,” said Maximilian Klein, the head of international relations for Athleten Deutschland, a representative group for German athletes.Many national Olympic committees, facing pressure at home to speak out more forcefully on China’s human rights record, are now grumbling about what they feel is a failure of leadership by the I.O.C. Some fear that the unwillingness of Olympic leaders to challenge or pressure China has left them, and their athletes, exposed to possible retribution during the Games.“In absence of them saying something, it shifts pressure to others to do so,” said one national Olympic committee official, who declined to be quoted by name out of fear of making an uncomfortable situation worse. “If we start being critical, all of a sudden it becomes more political if a nation starts to criticize China.”“We are the ones that need to keep our heads down,” the official added, “not the I.O.C.”The efforts of top Olympic officials to clarify Peng’s status have done little to ease the crisis of confidence. On Sunday, the I.O.C. released an image of a video call involving Peng and Thomas Bach, the I.O.C. president. The call was the first known contact between the tennis player and a Western sports official since she went public with her sexual assault allegations, and since China, which once hailed her successes in state media, quickly deleted them and then moved to erase any mention of her accusation.Rather than assuage concerns, though, the call only raised more questions about the relationship the I.O.C. enjoys with China’s government.The I.O.C. statement accompanying the image provided scant details of what was discussed during the 30-minute meeting with Peng, 35, and it conspicuously avoided reference to the sexual assault allegations against Zhang Gaoli, a former vice premier of China who retired in 2018. Zhang was vice premier when Beijing was awarded the Winter Olympics in 2015, and he led an organizational committee that oversaw preparations. In 2016, he met Bach during a visit to China.In the single image released by the I.O.C., Peng is smiling broadly in a room filled with plush toys, including mascots from previous Olympics. The I.O.C. statement said Bach ended the call by suggesting he and Peng try to meet for dinner when he arrives in Beijing in January. The committee did not release any audio or transcript of what Peng said in her own words or suggest Bach or anyone else asked her about her sexual assault claims.“To just kind of whitewash the whole thing — ‘Nothing to see here!’— is generally problematic,” said Sarah Cook, the director of research for China at Freedom House, a rights organization based in Washington, D.C., referring to the I.O.C.’s handling of the case and its relationship generally with the Olympic hosts. “Collaborating with the Chinese government to suppress people’s rights is different than anything that has been done before.”Richard Pound, a Canadian lawyer and the I.O.C.’s longest-serving member, defended the organization’s tactics — and took aim at its critics — in an interview last week.“What the I.O.C. established is that quiet and discreet diplomacy gets you better than clashing cymbals,” Pound said. “That’s n",The handling of the Peng Shuai case raised new questions about the I.O.C.s relationship with China.

Anyone can read what you share.By Amy Qin and Paul MozurWhen the Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai accused a former top leader of sexual assault earlier this month, the authorities turned to a tried-and-true strategy. At home, the country’s censors scrubbed away any mention of the allegations. Abroad, a few state-affiliated journalists focused narrowly on trying to quash concerns about Ms. Peng’s safety.Beijing seems to be relying on a two-pronged approach of maintaining the silence and waiting for the world to move on. The approach suggests that the country’s sprawling propaganda apparatus has limited options for shifting the narrative without drawing more attention to the uncomfortable allegations Beijing hopes would just disappear.On China’s social media platforms and other digital public squares, the censors’ meticulous work has left almost no sign that Ms. Peng had ever accused Zhang Gaoli, a former vice premier, of sexual assault. Like a museum to a previous reality, her social media account remains, without new updates or comments.These tactics have worked for China in the past, at least at home. In recent years, officials have relied on heavy censorship and a nationalistic narrative of Western meddling to deflect blame for issues including the outbreak of Covid-19 and human rights abuses in Xinjiang.This time, though, the #MeToo accusation from a lauded and patriotic athlete implicating a top leader has no simple solution from Beijing’s propaganda toolbox. Any new narrative would most likely have to acknowledge the allegations in the first place and require the approval of top Chinese leaders.“The central propaganda bureau does not dare go out on its own about a former Standing Committee member,” said Deng Yuwen, a former editor of a Communist Party newspaper, referring to Mr. Zhang’s position in the body that holds ultimate power in the party. “It would have to be approved by Xi Jinping.”“For them, this is not just a propaganda matter, but also an issue of national security,” continued Mr. Deng, who now lives in the United States.The level of censorship Beijing deployed to shut down discussion of Ms. Peng’s allegation has little precedent, said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley.To the Chinese authorities, the plan of action for now appears to be one of inaction. On overseas sites like Twitter and Facebook that are blocked in China, the response has been muted and fragmentary. When Beijing-backed journalists have addressed Ms. Peng on overseas social media sites, they have studiously avoided mentioning the nature of her accusations, or their target.Instead, they have sought to put an end to the questions about Ms. Peng’s whereabouts, releasing photos and videos of the tennis star that seemed designed to show that she was safe despite having disappeared from public life. Ms. Peng also appeared in a live video call with the leader of the International Olympic Committee that only raised more concerns.To some, the apparent stage-managing of Ms. Peng was a reminder of the authorities’ use of forced confessions and other video testimony from detainees for propaganda. In 2019, a state run news service ran a “proof of life” video of Abdurehim Heyit, a prominent Uyghur folk poet and musician, to quell international concerns that he had died in an internment camp.When Peter Dahlin, a Swedish activist, was detained by the authorities in 2016, he was forced to speak in a Chinese propaganda video about his so-called crimes. He said in a recent interview that he saw the state media’s gradual release of photos and videos of Ms. Peng as evidence that Beijing was monitoring her movements mainly to silence her while waiting for the outcry to die down.“She is obviously under custodial control,” Mr. Dahlin said. “Everything she does will be scripted from beginning to end; she will be told exactly what to do, how to act, how to smile.”A waiting game has helped Beijing defang attacks from individual critics in the past, be they dissidents or sports stars. When Hao Haidong, a retired Chinese soccer star, called for the downfall of the Chinese Communist Party in 2020, officials purged records of his career and waited as he faded from memory. Though Ms. Peng brings more international backing, Chinese officials may be betting the social media cycle of shock and anger will eventually dissipate.For Beijing, the concern is that the blowback could interfere with the upcoming Winter Olympics, which China is hosting.“They have to placate not just the usual critics in the West, but also decidedly apolitical tennis stars and sporting associations overseas, while at the same time burying all mention of Ms. Peng’s original charge,” said Richard McGregor, a se",Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai accused a former top leader of sexual assault.

WP,Peng Shuai,1,What you need to know about the case of Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/11/19/peng-shuai-what-to-know/?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_source=twitter,"When Peng Shuai alleged in a Nov. 2 social media post that she was sexually assaulted by China’s former vice premier Zhang Gaoli, it quickly made waves in China. But it was what happened after that shook the world. Peng disappeared from public life. Discussion of her allegations and fate were censored on social media, only reappearing in a carefully curated way over the past weekend as international outrage grew. China’s media blackout was designed to stem domestic discussion of the allegations against Zhang, just one of the string of #MeToo allegations involving high-profile men but unusual in that it named a top official, rather than a celebrity. But internationally it has backfired, breathing new life into already existing calls for nations to boycott the upcoming Winter Olympics, set to begin Feb. 4 in Beijing. On Sunday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) appeared on CBS’s “Face the Nation” where he called for a diplomatic boycott of the event, which would see U.S. officials stay away from the Chinese capital but U.S. athletes still compete. “I really hope our young men and women, that they go over there and kick their commie asses,” Cruz said. “We need to win in the Olympics.” Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin had previously reported that the Biden administration was already considering such a move. “Sooner rather than later, according to several sources familiar with the plans, the White House is expected to announce that neither President Biden nor any other U.S. government officials will attend the Beijing Games,” Rogin wrote Nov. 16. Biden later confirmed publicly that he was considering the measure. Now, however, Peng’s sudden disappearance from the spotlight, as well as her odd reappearance amid global scrutiny, may make this look like a half measure. Rights groups, including those focused on Tibet and Xinjiang, have been calling for a boycott for months. Hard line Republicans, such as former secretary of state Mike Pompeo and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), have called on the Biden administration to go further and restrict U.S. athletes from competing at all. “If the Chinese Communist Party will take its own athletes and disappear them and then march them out in hostage videos like this, what will they do to our athletes?” Cotton said on Fox News on Monday. A full Olympic boycott would be a big move for Washington. Though the United States famously boycotted the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, then the capital city of its Cold War rival the Soviet Union — and suffered a retaliatory Communist boycott four years later when Los Angeles hosted — in general, Washington has tried to keep politics out of the Games. In 1936, as relations soured with Nazi Germany, the United States did not boycott the Summer Games being held in Berlin. Instead, it made history as the African American athlete Jesse Owens won four gold medals — a first for any U.S. track and field athlete at the Olympics and an embarrassment for Adolf Hitler and fellow Nazi holders of racist theories. China has scoffed at the idea that a boycott would hurt them. “We are firmly opposed to any words and deeds that politicize sports in violation of the Olympic spirit,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Monday. But state media appears to be slowly admitting such a boycott could happen. On Monday, party tabloid the Global Times published an editorial that “anti-Chinese forces” were converging ahead of the Games, but said it provided an opportunity for “China’s growth in mentality as a major power.” As The Post’s Lily Kuo reported last week, these Games have special meaning. When Beijing hosted the Summer Games in 2008, it was interpreted as a sign that China had arrived on the world stage. Now, they carry a message about a newly confident China. “The Beijing Winter Olympics are Xi Jinping’s Games,” Xu Guoqi, a historian at the University of Hong Kong, told The Post. A diplomatic boycott could well be an embarrassment for Xi, but its success may depend on what other countries join it. Aside from the United States, other nations like Britain and Canada are reportedly considering it. But smaller nations may well be mindful of the wrath of Beijing. “An incoherent response will only underline the west’s lack of resolve,” the Guardian’s Patrick Wintour wrote on Monday. A broader boycott would certainly hit harder. It could also address some of the concerns about safety that Cotton and other advocates have espoused. But it would also throw U.S. athletes into the center of a political maelstrom, with many missing out on what could be their only shot at Olympic gold. Peng has reappeared, but the pressure on Beijing hasn’t disappeared yet. After Shuai had a series of appearances that struck many observers as unsettling, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach had a half-hour video call with the Chinese tennis player Sunday.

WP,Peng Shuai,2,Women’s Tennis Association threatens to pull out of China over star player’s disappearance,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-wta-peng-tennis/2021/11/19/ff2c2b68-4904-11ec-beca-3cc7103bd814_story.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social,"The head of the Women’s Tennis Association said the organization is willing to pull out of China, potentially losing hundreds of millions of dollars, if sexual assault allegations made by star tennis player Peng Shuai against a senior Chinese official are not properly investigated.Peng, 35, one of China’s most popular sports figures and a two-time Grand Slam champion in doubles, has not been seen in public for over two weeks after she shared a post online accusing former vice premier Zhang Gaoli of coercing her into having sex with him.WTA chairman and CEO Steve Simon, who has expressed concern for Peng’s safety and called for a full investigation into the claims, told CNN on Thursday: “We’re definitely willing to pull our business and deal with all the complications that come with it.”Simon’s remarks come as a chorus grows around the world calling for more transparency and information on Peng’s whereabouts. On Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration joins “in the calls for [Chinese] authorities to provide independent, verifiable proof of [Peng’s] whereabouts and that she is safe. . . . We support a woman’s ability to speak out and seek accountability, whether here or around the world.”President Biden on Thursday said the administration is “considering” a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics, in which government officials would abstain from attending the Games but athletes would still compete.Biden says U.S. ‘considering’ diplomatic boycott of Winter Olympics in ChinaOn Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian called U.S. allegations of mass repression of minorities in Xinjiang, the main impetus behind calls for the boycott, “a joke to Chinese people.”“Politicizing sports is against the Olympic spirit and harms the interests of athletes from all countries,” he said.Peng, who in 2014 became the first Chinese tennis player to be ranked No. 1 in doubles in the WTA, has competed in three Olympic Games. On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee took a different approach from the WTA and said in a statement that it had “seen the latest reports” regarding Peng and was “encouraged by assurances that she is safe.”The post on Peng’s official Weibo profile on Nov. 2 marked the most high-profile #MeToo allegation in China, where authorities have squashed the grass-roots movement, as well as an unprecedented public accusation against a top Chinese official. The post, whose authenticity could not be independently verified by The Washington Post, was removed within half an hour, and all discussion of Peng has since been censored.China has maintained silence over Peng’s case. Asked about her on Thursday, spokesman Zhao said he was “not aware” of the case, according to the Associated Press. The exchange was not included in the ministry’s official summary of the briefing released later.On Friday, Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-run Global Times, posted on Twitter — a platform that is blocked in China but used by Chinese diplomats and state media to target international audiences — that he did not believe Peng had “received retaliation and repression speculated by foreign media for the thing people talked about.”Yet the case continues to garner international attention, with the United Nations Human Rights Office calling Friday for “an investigation with full transparency.” Tennis stars including Naomi Osaka, Serena Williams and Billie Jean King have been posting under the hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai, pleading for Peng’s whereabouts to be accounted for. A statement purportedly by Peng, released by the state-run China Global Television Network on Wednesday, only added fuel to concerns over the tennis player’s safety.“I’m not missing, nor am I unsafe. I’ve just been resting at home and everything is fine,” read the message, which CGTN said was sent by email to Simon. The WTA issued a statement in response, with Simon saying that he had a “hard time believing that Peng actually wrote the email” or “believes what is being attributed to her.”Observers warned that Peng’s statement — a reminder of previous cases where, following international outcry, disappeared residents re-emerged on camera to say that they were  fine — should not be taken at face value.“The Chinese government has a long history of arbitrarily detaining people involved in controversial cases, controlling their ability to speak freely, and making them give forced statements,” said William Nee, research and advocacy coordinator for the nonprofit Chinese Human Rights Defenders.In the post published on Peng’s account, Peng said that three years ago, Zhang and his wife invited her to their home for a meal; there, Zhang coerced an unwilling Peng into having sex with him and the two entered into a long-term affair. Zhang, who is four decades older than her, was China’s vice premier from 2013 until 2018 when he retired.“That afternoon I didn’t agree at first and kept crying,” the post said, adding, “I know I ca","WTA chief Steve Simon said the organization is willing to pull out of China if sexual assault allegations are not properly investigated.

WP,Peng Shuai,3,Olympics official warns that Peng Shuai case ‘may spin out of control’ as images of tennis star raise questions,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/11/20/peng-shaui-china-ioc-member-comments/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter,"The crisis over the whereabouts of Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai, which has sparked a global outcry, “may spin out of control” and push the International Olympic Committee into taking a harder line with Beijing, an Olympics official warned.Peng, 35, a three-time Olympian and a two-time Grand Slam champion in doubles, has not spoken in public for more than two weeks after she accused a former vice premier in an online post of sexually assaulting her about three years ago. Her post — and discussion of it — was quickly censored on Chinese social media.Photos and videos have emerged in recent days showing Peng at a restaurant and a tennis match, but there have been questions about their authenticity.Star athletes such as Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka have demanded information on her, while the United Nations’ human rights office has called for proof of Peng’s safety.If there is no proper investigation into Peng’s sexual assault allegations, the Women’s Tennis Association is willing to pull tournaments out of China, potentially losing hundreds of millions of dollars, its chairman said Thursday.Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai is missing. Here is what you need to know.The IOC has not indicated that it intends to make a similar move with the 2022 Beijing Games, which could jeopardize billions of dollars from one of the world’s biggest sports events. Its press office has said that “quiet diplomacy offers the best opportunity to find a solution.”The IOC Athletes’ Commission said Saturday that it supports that approach. “[We] hope it will lead to the release of information about the whereabouts of Peng Shuai and confirmation of her safety and well-being,” its statement said. “We also hope that a way can be found for direct engagement between her and her athlete colleagues.”Senior member Dick Pound told Reuters on Friday, however, that the IOC was following the case and that “if that’s not resolved in a sensible way very soon it may spin out of control.”“Whether that escalates to a cessation of the Olympic Games, I doubt it. But you never know.”The scrutiny has already added to existing momentum for a boycott of the upcoming Winter Olympics. President Biden’s administration says it is “considering” a diplomatic boycott. China has dismissed accusations of human rights abuses and calls for a boycott as “distractions” from the Games.Meanwhile, a Chinese state media journalist on Friday shared photos of Peng, which he said she posted on the messaging app WeChat along with the words “Happy weekend.” The editor of the state-run Global Times said Saturday that the athlete had “stayed in her own home freely” but “will show up in public and participate in some activities soon.”The photos, which show a smiling Peng holding a cat in a room full of stuffed toys, did little to assuage concerns, with human rights researchers saying the images only raised more questions and commenters questioning the authenticity of the post.Later Saturday, the Global Times editor shared videos of Peng at a restaurant.WTA chairman Steve Simon said he was glad to see the footage but that it was not enough. “While it is positive to see her, it remains unclear if she is free and able to make decisions and take actions on her own, without coercion or external interference,” he said. “I have been clear about what needs to happen and our relationship with China is at a crossroads.”A BBC China media analyst noted that in a sign on the restaurant door in the video, the date appeared to have been “blurred over” — showing only the month, not the day it was purportedly shot.A third video emerged early Sunday, also posted on the Twitter account of Hu Xijin, the Global Times editor, who described it as showing Peng attending the opening ceremony of a teenage tennis match final in Beijing on Sunday morning.Peng was also shown in official photos published by the tournament organized by China Open. Peng can be seen among guests at the Fila Kids Junior Tennis Challenge on China Open’s Weibo account. The Chinese state-run newspaper the China Daily had previously reported that the finals of the junior competition would be held on Nov. 21.An email purportedly from Peng that was released by the state-run China Global Television Network earlier this week also was met with skepticism. Simon said he had a “hard time believing that Peng Shuai actually wrote the email” to him, in which she said she was neither unsafe nor missing.“I have repeatedly tried to reach her via numerous forms of communication, to no avail,” Simon said. “The WTA and the rest of the world need independent and verifiable proof that she is safe.”Rachel Pannett contributed to this article.Read more:Women’s Tennis Association threatens to pull out of China over star player’s disappearanceBiden says U.S. ‘considering’ diplomatic boycott of Winter Olympics in China.

WP,Peng Shuai,4,IOC says President Thomas Bach had video call with missing tennis player Peng Shuai,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2021/11/21/peng-shuai-thomas-bach/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter,"International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach had a half-hour video call with Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai, the Olympic governing body said Sunday, amid global concerns about Peng’s safety.In announcing the call on its website, the IOC showed a picture of Bach speaking with Peng, who is visible on a monitor. The IOC said Bach was joined on the call by IOC Athletes Commission chair Emma Terho and IOC board member Li Lingwei, a friend of Peng’s who is in China.Worries about Peng’s safety have grown in recent weeks after she accused a former high-level Chinese official of sexual assault in a social media post Nov. 2. In the days after making the accusation, Peng’s name could no longer be found on Chinese search engines and she was not seen in public for more than two weeks. Photos and videos of her posted on social media by Chinese state-run media in recent days have done little to assuage fears for her well-being, with human rights researchers saying the images only raised more questions.In Sunday’s announcement, the IOC said Peng “explained that she is safe and well, living at her home in Beijing, but would like to have her privacy respected at this time.”It went on to say: “That is why she prefers to spend her time with friends and family right now. Nevertheless, she will continue to be involved in tennis, the sport she loves so much.”“I was relieved to see that Peng Shuai was doing fine, which was our main concern,” Terho said in the statement. “She appeared to be relaxed. I offered her our support and to stay in touch at any time of her convenience, which she obviously appreciated.”The IOC did not explain why Peng chose to speak with the organization Sunday despite having not spoken to other sports or international entities, including the Women’s Tennis Association, whose chairman and CEO Steve Simon has been demanding proof that she is safe and not facing punishment from Chinese officials for her allegation.In a statement later Sunday, a WTA spokesperson said: “It was good to see Peng Shuai in recent videos, but they don’t alleviate or address the WTA’s concern about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion. This video does not change our call for a full, fair and transparent investigation, without censorship, into her allegation of sexual assault, which is the issue that gave rise to our initial concern.”Peng’s recent disappearance has brought fresh criticism to the IOC for holding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing despite China’s recent record of human rights abuses. President Biden said Thursday that his administration is “considering” a diplomatic boycott of the Games, which would allow U.S. athletes to compete but keep government officials from attending.On Friday, IOC executive Dick Pound told Reuters that the crisis over Peng’s whereabouts “may spin out of control” and force the IOC into taking a harder stance.According to the IOC’s statement Sunday, Bach invited Peng to dinner along with Terho and Lingwei when he arrives in Beijing in late January and Peng accepted the invitation.",Tennis player Peng Shuai has a half-hour video call with Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai.

A rare exception was a Chinese-language statement posted by the French Embassy in China on the social network Weibo on Monday, which expressed concern for Peng and called on China to uphold its pledge to combat violence against women.“We express our concern over the lack of information regarding tennis player Peng Shuai’s situation,” the French Embassy statement said.The embassy called Peng a “tennis athlete who rose to prominence due to the French Open.” Peng and her partner won a women’s doubles title at the French Open in 2014 and at Wimbledon in 2013.The tennis star’s reemergence came after heavy international pressure and seemed aimed primarily at assuaging outrage from prominent overseas sports authorities and fellow players concerned about her safety. Chinese state media outlets used Twitter, which is blocked in China, to announce that Peng was free and doing well, with photos and video of her at a restaurant and a youth tennis event.She also spoke by video on Sunday to International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, though the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) said that did not alleviate concerns about her well-being and her ability to communicate without censorship or coercion.Notably absent from these official appearances has been any mention of her sexual assault allegations against Zhang, the retired senior official, who has maintained a public silence. China’s State Council Information Office did not reply on Monday to a faxed question about whether Chinese prosecutors would investigate her allegations and has not responded to requests to make Zhang available for interview.Several other prominent #MeToo cases in China’s business and academic circles have resulted in police investigations and trials. But Peng’s allegations are the first against such a high-level official in China, and it’s unclear how Beijing will respond.Within China, Peng’s return has been cryptic, with nearly all mention of her allegations against Zhang remaining under official blackout. Some photos of her surfaced without explanation on domestic websites over the weekend, such as the China Open posting close-up shots of Peng at a youth tennis event without mentioning her name.On Monday, it remained impossible to post a message on Weibo containing both Peng’s and Zhang’s names, with a pop-up message saying the operation was not possible because it was “a violation of relevant laws and regulations.”Olympics official warns that Peng Shuai case ‘may spin out of control’ as images of tennis star raise questionsWhile searches for Peng’s name returned no hits on Chinese social media platforms earlier this month in the wake of her allegations, some older state-media articles about her could be found on Monday, with the comments sections disabled.In some corners of the Chinese Internet, users made cautious comments about her return on Monday.“Hope that a thorough investigation will give the people an explanation,” one reader remarked.Outside of China, there have been increasingly loud calls for proof of her safety, with an Olympics official telling Reuters that it could affect the Beijing Winter Olympics scheduled to take place in February. WTA Chairman Steve Simon said Thursday that the organization is willing to pull out of China, potentially losing hundreds of millions of dollars, if Peng’s allegations are not properly investigated.Tennis stars such as Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka have called for information about her well-being.

WP,Peng Shuai,6,Analysis: Peng Shuai’s courage reinvigorates calls for a Beijing Olympic boycott,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/11/23/peng-shaui-olympic-boycott-calls/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter,"When Peng Shuai alleged in a Nov. 2 social media post that she was sexually assaulted by China’s former vice premier Zhang Gaoli, it quickly made waves in China. But it was what happened after that shook the world. Peng disappeared from public life. Discussion of her allegations and fate were censored on social media, only reappearing in a carefully curated way over the past weekend as international outrage grew.China’s media blackout was designed to stem domestic discussion of the allegations against Zhang, just one of the string of #MeToo allegations involving high-profile men but unusual in that it named a top official, rather than a celebrity. But internationally it has backfired, breathing new life into already existing calls for nations to boycott the upcoming Winter Olympics, set to begin Feb. 4 in Beijing.On Sunday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) appeared on CBS’s “Face the Nation” where he called for a diplomatic boycott of the event, which would see U.S. officials stay away from the Chinese capital but U.S. athletes still compete. “I really hope our young men and women, that they go over there and kick their commie asses,” Cruz said. “We need to win in the Olympics.”Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin had previously reported that the Biden administration was already considering such a move. “Sooner rather than later, according to several sources familiar with the plans, the White House is expected to announce that neither President Biden nor any other U.S. government officials will attend the Beijing Games,” Rogin wrote Nov. 16. Biden later confirmed publicly that he was considering the measure.Now, however, Peng’s sudden disappearance from the spotlight, as well as her odd reappearance amid global scrutiny, may make this look like a half measure. Rights groups, including those focused on Tibet and Xinjiang, have been calling for a boycott for months. Hard line Republicans, such as former secretary of state Mike Pompeo and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), have called on the Biden administration to go further and restrict U.S. athletes from competing at all.“If the Chinese Communist Party will take its own athletes and disappear them and then march them out in hostage videos like this, what will they do to our athletes?” Cotton said on Fox News on Monday.A full Olympic boycott would be a big move for Washington. Though the United States famously boycotted the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, then the capital city of its Cold War rival the Soviet Union — and suffered a retaliatory Communist boycott four years later when Los Angeles hosted — in general, Washington has tried to keep politics out of the Games.In 1936, as relations soured with Nazi Germany, the United States did not boycott the Summer Games being held in Berlin. Instead, it made history as the African American athlete Jesse Owens won four gold medals — a first for any U.S. track and field athlete at the Olympics and an embarrassment for Adolf Hitler and fellow Nazi holders of racist theories.China has scoffed at the idea that a boycott would hurt them. “We are firmly opposed to any words and deeds that politicize sports in violation of the Olympic spirit,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Monday. But state media appears to be slowly admitting such a boycott could happen.On Monday, party tabloid the Global Times published an editorial that “anti-Chinese forces” were converging ahead of the Games, but said it provided an opportunity for “China’s growth in mentality as a major power.”As The Post’s Lily Kuo reported last week, these Games have special meaning. When Beijing hosted the Summer Games in 2008, it was interpreted as a sign that China had arrived on the world stage. Now, they carry a message about a newly confident China. “The Beijing Winter Olympics are Xi Jinping’s Games,” Xu Guoqi, a historian at the University of Hong Kong, told The Post.A diplomatic boycott could well be an embarrassment for Xi, but its success may depend on what other countries join it. Aside from the United States, other nations like Britain and Canada are reportedly considering it. But smaller nations may well be mindful of the wrath of Beijing. “An incoherent response will only underline the west’s lack of resolve,” the Guardian’s Patrick Wintour wrote on Monday.A broader boycott would certainly hit harder. It could also address some of the concerns about safety that Cotton and other advocates have espoused. But it would also throw U.S. athletes into the center of a political maelstrom, with many missing out on what could be their only shot at Olympic gold.Peng has reappeared, but the pressure on Beijing hasn’t disappeared yet. After Shuai had a series of appearances that struck many observers as unsettling, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach had a half-hour video call with the Chinese tennis player Sunday. In an announcement, the IOC said Peng “explained that she is safe and well, living at her home in Beijing, but would like to have her ",Pengaiai alleged she was sexually assaulted by China's former vice premier Zhang Gaoli.

Her social media post was quickly deleted and the topic has been blocked from discussion on China's heavily censored internet.  read more The WTA's aggressive expansion into China had begun a decade earlier, just before the 2008 Beijing Olympic tennis tournament was played out in a state-of-the-art new facility, with the tour opening an Asia-Pacific headquarters in the Chinese capital.Local interest in the sport was fuelled by Li Na winning the 2011 French Open and, although her breakthrough was not followed by more Chinese success on court, the expansion continued.In 2008, China hosted just two WTA events. That grew to nine by 2019.According to figures provided by the WTA, the total prize money on offer for those nine tournaments totalled $30.4 million, including the $14 million for the first edition of the season-ending WTA Finals in Shenzhen.By doubling the Finals prize pot - which was $5 million more than the men's 2019 ATP Finals in London - and promising to build a new 12,000-seat venue, Shenzhen saw off rival bids from Singapore, Manchester, Prague and St Petersburg to bag a 10-year deal for the prestigious event.WTA Chief Executive Steve Simon described the deal as ""easily the largest and most significant Finals deal in the 45 years since the WTA was founded"".'BUSINESS IS SECONDARY'Before the Shenzhen agreement, the WTA had also announced a 10-year deal starting 2017 with streaming platform iQiyi as its digital rights partner in China, reportedly worth $120 million.But Simon said the WTA was prepared to walk away if it was not satisfied with the response to Peng's allegation.""We're definitely willing to pull our business and deal with all the complications that come with it,"" he told CNN on Thursday.The WTA had already called for assurances that Peng was safe and a transparent investigation.""Our sport is focusing on the health and safety of Peng Shuai, business is secondary,"" Stacey Allaster, who was the WTA's CEO from 2009-15, told Reuters this week. ""This is a very important moment for the WTA's business and history.""In the past China has been quick to respond to any criticism from outside.Two years ago, after then-Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey made comments in support of the democracy movement in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, state broadcaster CCTV stopped broadcasting NBA games.The NBA apologised and his tweet was deleted, though it was 15 months before another Houston game was shown on Chinese TV.Last month, Boston Celtics highlights were removed from China's Tencent Holdings Ltd's sports platform after centre Enes Kanter criticized Chinese President Xi Jinping and China's treatment of Tibet.After all its China tournaments were wiped out in 2020 due to COVID-19, Simon had told Reuters that a significant amount of WTA's revenues came from the country. Its showpiece Finals were cancelled last year and in 2021 moved to Guadalajara in Mexico, although the WTA, before Peng's allegation came to light, said it would return to Shenzhen from 2022 until 2030.",Former doubles world number one Peng Shuai claims former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli coerced her into sex.

Nevertheless, she will continue to be involved in tennis, the sport she loves so much.""France's foreign minister had earlier called on the Chinese authorities to provide more reassurance, echoing a statement by the Women's Tennis Association that the images of Peng at the tournament were ""insufficient"" proof.""I'm expecting only one thing: that she speaks,"" France's Jean-Yves Le Drian told LCI television, adding that there could be unspecified diplomatic consequences if China did not clear up the situation. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the IOC's statement.The United States and Britain had also called for China to provide proof of Peng's whereabouts.Current and former tennis players, from Naomi Osaka to Serena Williams to Billie Jean King, had joined the calls seeking to confirm she was safe, using the social media hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai? World No.1 Novak Djokovic said it would be strange to hold tournaments in China unless the ""horrific"" situation was resolved. The concern over Peng came as global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February over China's human rights record.Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai signs large-sized tennis balls at the opening ceremony of Fila Kids Junior Tennis Challenger Final in Beijing, China November 21, 2021, in this screen grab obtained from a social media video.

Peng, 35, was the world No.1 doubles player in 2014, the first Chinese player to achieve a top ranking, after winning the doubles titles at Wimbledon in 2013 and the French Open in 2014. On Saturday night, Peng visited a popular restaurant in downtown Beijing, according to a video posted by Hu that a restaurant manager confirmed to Reuters on Sunday.Seven people including Peng were at the Sichuanese restaurant, said the manager, Zhou Hongmei, adding that they ate in a private room and were joined by the restaurant's owner.""It was crowded at the restaurant as usual,"" Zhou said, showing a bill that included noodles and bamboo shoots.

Chinese politician accused by tennis star Peng keeps out of sight,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/where-is-zhang-gaoli-chinese-politician-accused-by-tennis-star-peng-keeps-out-2021-11-24/?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=twitter,"Even as Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai appeared on a video call with the Olympics chief, the former vice premier she accused of sexual assault has stayed silent and out of sight - maintaining the veil of secrecy that shrouds China's political elite.Zhang Gaoli, who turns 75 this month, was accused by the former Olympian in a Nov. 2 social media post of coercing her into sex three years ago. Peng said she and Zhang, who was vice premier when Beijing was awarded the upcoming Winter Games, had conducted an on-off consensual relationship until he broke up with her.Her post was deleted soon after it was published and the topic has been blocked online in China. But when she vanished from public view for nearly three weeks, international concern for her safety was ignited, accompanied by the #WhereIsPengShuai hashtag.Peng, 35, made a series of appearances over the past weekend, including a video call with International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach, but they have failed to dispel doubts among fellow athletes and global organisations over her welfare. Amnesty International accused the IOC and Bach of taking part in a ""whitewash of possible human rights violations"" by China ahead of the Games in February.Less attention has focused on Zhang, who retired in 2018 and like nearly all top Chinese leaders stays out of the public eye in retirement. He and the Chinese government have not directly commented on Peng's claims, which Reuters has been unable to verify.China's State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and has not commented on Peng's post or made Zhang available for comment.""Letting Zhang come out to speak will result in a reputational loss that it doesn't want just before the Winter Games,"" said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.""Even if the party does decide to take internal disciplinary action against Zhang, they won't announce it right away, but will wait for the storm to blow over first, so as to show strength,"" he added.TIANJIN BOSSZhang's last appearance was on July 1, when he was seated on the southern ramparts of the Forbidden City in Beijing for the 100th anniversary of the founding of China's ruling Communist Party. The site is not far from the Great Hall of the People where six years earlier he made a ""solemn commitment"" to a successful Winter Games at the Beijing Olympic Organising Committee's launch ceremony.From 2007 to 2012，Zhang was the top political leader in the city of Tianjin. Under his watch, the once run-down provincial-level metropolis southeast of Beijing became China's fastest growing region in 2011.As ranking vice premier from 2013 to 2018, he was in charge of economic matters, including President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road initiative, and headed a ""leading small group"" overseeing the Winter Olympics before handing over to current vice premier Han Zheng in 2018.In 2016, he met with Bach himself, telling the IOC boss that work was being done to ""make sure the 2022 Beijing Winter Games are fantastic, extraordinary and excellent,"" according to a report on the English-language website of the Chinese government.Peng alleged in her Weibo post that she first met Zhang and had sex with him in Tianjin. She said that soon after Zhang  retired, he got in touch again through a sports doctor and rekindled the relationship.""You stopped contacting me after you were promoted to Beijing. I had wanted to bury everything inside my heart. Since you don't intend to take responsibility, why did you still look for me, and force me to have sex with you at your house?"" she wrote.Peng also alleged in her post that Zhang's wife, Kang Jie, knew about the relationship. As with wives of most of China's political leaders, very little is known about Kang, including her age. The couple have a son.HISTORY OF SILENCEZhang's silence is consistent with how party leaders have dealt in the past with allegations ranging from corruption accusations in the Panama Papers to rumours of extramarital affairs, experts say.Making a sweeping campaign to root out corruption a hallmark of his nine-year tenure, Xi has demanded that party officials ""be able to pass the toughest tests"" of political, professional and family morals.Zhang's only option is silence, according to Chen Daoyin, formerly an associate professor at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law and now based in Chile, where he has been closely following the case.""If he denies, he won't be credible, because as a result of Xi's anti-corruption campaign, now everyone in China knows it is common for Chinese officials to use power for sex,"" Chen said.Typically, accusations of sexual misconduct by officials are only mentioned after an investigation for political or economic crimes, almost added as an aggravating factor.Having struggled to gain traction, China's #MeToo movement has come under fresh focus following the Peng case.

""There's so many digital approaches to contact people these days that we have, and to date we still have not been able to get a response.""Earlier this week, Chinese state media released an email, purportedly sent to Simon from Peng, walking back her allegations and claiming she is fine.The alleged email was released only on English-language platforms and domestic Chinese media have not reported on its contents, despite Peng being a household name in China.When asked about the email, Simon questioned its veracity, describing it as a ""staged statement of some type,"" noting he had yet to receive a follow-up reply, despite responding immediately.

Is she safe? Any information would be appreciated,"" she said in a post on Twitter. Tennis' popularity in China has grown rapidly over the past few decades, with several Chinese players breaking into the global rankings. The women's game, in particular, is a big market, thanks in part to the success of Chinese tennis star Li Na, who in 2011 became Asia's first grand slam singles tennis champion when she won the French Open, followed by a second major title at the 2014 Australian Open.In recent years, the WTA has made a big push into China. In 2019, China hosted several WTA tournaments, including the WTA Finals held in Shenzhen for the first time that year. The event is set to return to the Chinese city from 2022 and be held there every year until 2030, according to the WTA.The direct and highly public intervention of the WTA is unusual for an international sporting body. Perceived criticisms of China, which is also due to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, have previously resulted in significant public and political backlash, as well as loss of access. In 2019, the National Basketball Association (NBA) became caught between free speech and the lucrative Chinese market when Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. The response from China was severe, with the NBA's Chinese partners suspending ties, state broadcaster CCTV halting all broadcasts of preseason matches.Last month, NBA faced a similar firestorm with Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter's social media posts bringing awareness to China's treatment of the Uyghur community, Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Amnesty International also called on China to prove Peng is safe and to investigate the sexual assault allegations, saying the country has ""systematically silenced the country's #MeToo movement.""

CNN's Nectar Gan, Rhea Mogul, Erin Burnett and Yong Xiong contributed to reporting. Peng, 35, one of China's most recognizable athletes, accused former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of coercing her into sex, according to screenshots of a since-deleted social media post dated November 2.Chinese censors wiped out any mention of the accusation online and blocked her Weibo account from search results.Attempts by China to show Peng is safe -- including an email purportedly from Peng and several video clips of the athlete -- have only added to the concern over her safety. On Sunday, the International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach held a video phone call with Peng. Some of the sport's biggest names have called on China to confirm her safety and investigate her allegations. Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Chairman and CEO Steve Simon has threatened to pull out of China if Peng is not accounted for and her accusations not properly investigated. Here's what you need to know about the accusation -- and the evolving fallout.Who is Peng Shuai?Peng is a two-time Grand Slam doubles champion and one of China's top tennis players.From Hunan, in central China, the 35-year-old made history in 2014 when she became the first Chinese player -- male or female -- to achieve the world No.1 doubles ranking. Her two major doubles titles were won at Wimbledon in 2013 and the French Open in 2014. Peng also reached the singles semifinals at the 2014 US Open, and is a three-time Olympian. She's won 25 tour titles and obtained a No. 17 world singles rank.The international success of Peng and fellow Chinese tennis stars Li Na and Zheng Jie, has been credited with helping the sport's popularity soar in China, particularly for the women's game. Who is Zhang Gaoli and what accusations has Peng leveled?Zhang Gaoli, 75, served on the ruling Communist Party's seven-person Politiburo Standing Committee -- the country's supreme leadership body -- from 2012 to 2017 during Chinese leader Xi Jinping's first term in power. He retired as vice premier in 2018.In a since-deleted social media post dated November 2, Peng accused Zhang of coercing her into sex and alleges a relationship over an intermittent period that spanned at least 10 years.About three years ago, after Zhang had retired, the post alleges Peng was invited by him to play tennis in Beijing. Afterward, she wrote, Zhang and his wife brought Peng to their home, where Peng claimed she was pressured into having sex with Zhang.""That afternoon I did not agree at first and was crying all the time,"" Peng wrote. After dinner with Zhang and his wife, and following much persuading from Zhang, she relented, according to the post.""Why did you have to come back to me, took me to your home to force me to have sex with you?"" she wrote.""I couldn't describe how disgusted I was, and how many times I asked myself am I still a human? I feel like a walking corpse. Every day I was acting, which person is the real me?"" Peng said she did not have evidence to prove her allegations, and claimed Zhang was always worried that she would record things. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the more than 1,600-word post.What has happened to her?Peng's explosive #MeToo allegation prompted China's censors to respond at an unprecedented level.Her post on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, was deleted within 30 minutes of publication, and censors scrubbed any mention of the accusation online. Her Weibo account, which has more than half a million followers, is still blocked from searchers on the platform.For almost three weeks following the accusation, Peng was not seen in public and her whereabouts were not publicly disclosed.CNN has repeatedly reached out for comment to both her and China's State Council, which handles press inquires for the central government. WTA chief Simon told CNN he had been in conversation with counterparts at the Chinese Tennis Association, who had provided assurances Peng was unharmed in Beijing. However, attempts to reach Peng directly had proved unsuccessful, he said. ReappearanceNew video clips of the tennis star were tweeted by members of Chinese state media on November 20 and 21. One clip appears to show Peng sitting with China Open tournament co-director Zhang Junhui and two women around a table in a restaurant in Beijing. The clips appear to deliberately emphasize specific dates. Throughout the video, Zhang is speaking to Peng, but she doesn't say anything.On Sunday, members of Chinese state media released more videos on social media purporting to show Peng at a tennis event for teenagers in Beijing.

I have been clear about what needs to happen and our relationship with China is at a crossroads,"" Simon's statement said.What the clips showSeveral people connected to Chinese state media and sport system have tweeted photos and videos they say show Peng out to dinner on Saturday. The clips appear to deliberately emphasize specific dates.One of the video clips, only 45 seconds long, appears to show Peng sitting with China Open tournament co-director Zhang Junhui along with two women around a table in a restaurant in Beijing.Throughout the video, Zhang is speaking to Peng, but she doesn't say anything.At some point, according to CNN translation, Zhang said, ""Yes, this year is different from last year, because of the pandemic. Originally, we planned to have 10 tours in three months, isn't tomorrow November 20? We have long planned... ""But one of the two women quickly corrected him, saying, ""21st.""""Oh, November 21, tomorrow is November 21, we will have the final game at Zuanshi,"" Zhang continued.""We had larger-scale games before, but because of the pandemic, two tours have been affected. So it's estimated there will be fewer players, but the kids are still very enthusiastic,"" Zhang added.""So the players in tomorrow's game are the champions during the past nine tours in the past three months. You can see it's Sunday, at the end of November, so it's like a year-end final,"" Zhang said in the video.Another man, under the name Ding Li, also tweeted the same video and several new photos of Peng with him and others. He wrote, ""Peng Shuai is with me. We're at this restaurant in Beijing that's gone viral online, just finished dinner.""In his tweet, Ding claims the dinner is at Beijing Yibin Guesthouse. The name of the restaurant matches what's shown in this video posted by Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of state-run tabloid Global Times.On Sunday, members of Chinese state media released more videos on social media purporting to show Peng at a tennis event for teenagers in Beijing. Throughout the videos Peng says very little but is seen smiling. CNN cannot independently verify the two video clips or confirm when they were filmed. Growing pressureBeijing is facing growing worldwide pressure over Peng's whereabouts, including from the United Nations, the United States government, and the world's biggest tennis stars. The UN Human Rights Office has called for an investigation into her allegations of sexual assault.In a letter Friday, Simon called on China's ambassador to the US to prove Peng is safe and investigate her accusations of sexual assault. A spokesperson from the United Kingdom's Foreign Office said China should ""urgently provide verifiable evidence of her safety and whereabouts,"" according to Britain's Press Association. That statement came after new video emerged Saturday purporting to show Peng, but before Sunday's clips.Amid the global outcry, Chinese state media's Twitter accounts, with Hu's being among the most active, have been increasingly posting anonymously sourced information about the tennis star, ostensibly aimed at quelling the controversy without acknowledging her claim against Zhang.Chinese state media organizations such as the Global Times are strictly controlled by China's propaganda authorities. Their tweets about Peng are not reported inside China, which has long banned Twitter and other international social media platforms.Peng's post about the alleged sexual assault posted on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, was deleted within 30 minutes of publication, with Chinese censors moving swiftly to wipe out any mention of the accusation online. Her Weibo account, which has more than half a million followers, is still blocked from searchers on the platform.Simon, the WTA chief, said on Friday he is willing to lose hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business in China if Peng is not fully accounted for and her a",China's Women's Tennis Association says new video shows Peng Shuai.

NYT,Supply chain,1,"Inflation Warning Signs Flash Red, Posing Challenge for Washington",https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/business/economy/inflation-supply-chain.html,"Inflation, once expected to fade quickly, is proving more stubborn. That ramps up tension among officials as they wait for pressures to fade.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Jeanna SmialekThe Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation climbed in August at the quickest pace in 30 years, data released on Friday showed, keeping policymakers on edge as evidence mounts that rapidly rising prices are poised to last longer than practically any of them had expected earlier this year.The numbers come at a pivotal moment, as inflationary warning signals abound. Used car prices show signs of picking up again, costs for raw goods like cotton and crude oil are increasing and companies continue to experience pain from persistent supply chain disruptions.That is stoking fears in Washington and on Wall Street that although rapid price gains will eventually fade, the adjustment could drag on for months. A longer burst of inflation raises the chances that consumers will change their expectations and behavior, paving the way for more permanent price increases.It is a high-stakes juncture for policymakers. The Fed is preparing to withdraw some of its support for the economy soon, but it would prefer to do so only gradually, given the millions of Americans who remain out of work. The White House is trying to pass two big policy packages at the core of President Biden’s economic agenda, and Republicans have begun wielding every new inflation data point as an argument against more federal spending.Pandemic-related disruptions have caused the bulk of this year’s pop in prices, which is why economists and White House officials continue to predict they will eventually recede. A spike in demand from stuck-at-home workers and families for furniture, electronics and other products collided with factory shutdowns in Asia and overwhelmed shipping routes.The inflation measure released on Friday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, rose 4.3 percent in the year through August, beating out the previous month’s reading of 4.2 percent. And it is increasingly clear that getting back to normal will not be a quick process. Factory shutdowns continue to ripple through the global supply chain. Shipping snarls may worsen as the holiday season approaches. Rents are rebounding at a breakneck pace after a pandemic swoon, threatening to push housing inflation — an important part of overall price indexes — higher.“It’s still quite an inflationary environment going into next year, and that isn’t going to be good for growth,” said Laura Rosner-Warburton, an economist at the research firm MacroPolicy Perspectives. “They need to be monitoring things very closely. This is a huge shock.”Wages are rising, but in many cases not quickly enough to overcome the rapid run-up in prices, Ms. Rosner-Warburton pointed out. A reduction in purchasing power threatens to create a cycle in which consumers buy less while goods and services are becoming more expensive because of supply limits, a situation often called “stagflation.”That remains a risk — not a baseline expectation — but the possibility of lingering inflation increasingly worries economists, companies and even some policymakers.It is “frustrating to see the bottlenecks and supply chain problems not getting better — in fact, at the margin, apparently getting a little bit worse,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed’s chair, said while speaking on a panel on Wednesday. “We see that continuing into next year, probably, and holding inflation up longer than we had thought.”Phil Levy, the chief economist at the logistics firm Flexport, said his company expected supply chain issues to begin easing next summer at the earliest. But as labor issues bubble up at long-overburdened ports, that could take even longer.And in the near term, trouble finding shipping space could translate to shortages of toys and trinkets during the holiday season, causing companies to lift prices to make sure their supply lasts, Mr. Levy said.“Ports are under strain, with ships backed up. We are short on truckers. We have warehouses that are packed full,” he said, later adding: “There was a sense a year ago that this would be a short-lived thing — there would be a craze, a squeeze, and then it would let up. The interpretation of ‘transitory’ has changed.”While central bankers have long expected price gains to slow down, their guesses at how quickly that moderation will happen have been increasingly glum. In their latest economic projections, Fed officials forecast that the Personal Consumption Expenditures index will average 4.2 percent in the final quarter of 2021 — up from 3.4 percent in their June estimates — before declining to 2.2 percent by the end of next year.The Fed aims for 2 percent inflation on average over time, though it is happy to tolerate higher periods as long as they are not expected to last.Today’s price problem is a surprising one.

NYT,Supply chain,2,‘It’s Not Sustainable’: What America’s Port Crisis Looks Like Up Close,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11/business/supply-chain-crisis-savannah-port.html,"An enduring traffic jam at the Port of Savannah reveals why the chaos in global shipping is likely to persist.The Port of Savannah in Georgia is the third-largest container port in the United States.Credit... Supported byBy Peter S. GoodmanPhotographs by Erin SchaffSAVANNAH, Ga. — Like toy blocks hurled from the heavens, nearly 80,000 shipping containers are stacked in various configurations at the Port of Savannah — 50 percent more than usual.The steel boxes are waiting for ships to carry them to their final destination, or for trucks to haul them to warehouses that are themselves stuffed to the rafters. Some 700 containers have been left at the port, on the banks of the Savannah River, by their owners for a month or more.“They’re not coming to get their freight,” complained Griff Lynch, the executive director of the Georgia Ports Authority. “We’ve never had the yard as full as this.”As he speaks, another vessel glides silently toward an open berth — the 1,207-foot-long Yang Ming Witness, its decks jammed with containers full of clothing, shoes, electronics and other stuff made in factories in Asia. Towering cranes soon pluck the thousands of boxes off the ship — more cargo that must be stashed somewhere.“Certainly,” Mr. Lynch said, “the stress level has never been higher.”It has come to this in the Great Supply Chain Disruption: They are running out of places to put things at one of the largest ports in the United States. As major ports contend with a staggering pileup of cargo, what once seemed like a temporary phenomenon — a traffic jam that would eventually dissipate — is increasingly viewed as a new reality that could require a substantial refashioning of the world’s shipping infrastructure.As the Savannah port works through the backlog, Mr. Lynch has reluctantly forced ships to wait at sea for more than nine days. On a recent afternoon, more than 20 ships were stuck in the queue, anchored up to 17 miles off the coast in the Atlantic.Such lines have become common around the globe, from the more than 50 ships marooned last week in the Pacific near Los Angeles to smaller numbers bobbing off terminals in the New York area, to hundreds waylaid off ports in China.The turmoil in the shipping industry and the broader crisis in supply chains is showing no signs of relenting. It stands as a gnawing source of worry throughout the global economy, challenging once-hopeful assumptions of a vigorous return to growth as vaccines limit the spread of the pandemic.The disruption helps explain why Germany’s industrial fortunes are sagging, why inflation has become a cause for concern among central bankers, and why American manufacturers are now waiting a record 92 days on average to assemble the parts and raw materials they need to make their goods, according to the Institute of Supply Management.On the surface, the upheaval appears to be a series of intertwined product shortages. Because shipping containers are in short supply in China, factories that depend on Chinese-made parts and chemicals in the rest of the world have had to limit production.But the situation at the port of Savannah attests to a more complicated and insidious series of overlapping problems. It is not merely that goods are scarce. It is that products are stuck in the wrong places, and separated from where they are supposed to be by stubborn and constantly shifting barriers.The shortage of finished goods at retailers represents the flip side of the containers stacked on ships marooned at sea and massed on the riverbanks. The pileup in warehouses is itself a reflection of shortages of truck drivers needed to carry goods to their next destinations.For Mr. Lynch, the man in charge in Savannah, frustrations are enhanced by a sense of powerlessness in the face of circumstances beyond his control. Whatever he does to manage his docks alongside the murky Savannah River, he cannot tame the bedlam playing out on the highways, at the warehouses, at ports across the ocean and in factory towns around the world.“The supply chain is overwhelmed and inundated,” Mr. Lynch said. “It’s not sustainable at this point. Everything is out of whack.”Born and raised in Queens with the no-nonsense demeanor to prove it, Mr. Lynch, 55, has spent his professional life tending to the logistical complexities of sea cargo. (“I actually wanted to be a tugboat captain,” he said. “There was only one problem. I get seasick.”)Now, he is contending with a storm whose intensity and contours are unparalleled, a tempest that has effectively extended the breadth of oceans and added risk to sea journeys. Last month, his yard held 4,500 containers that had been stuck on the docks for at least three weeks. “That’s bordering on ridiculous,” he said.That these tensions are playing out even in Savannah attests to the magnitude of the disarray.

Now we do. Here’s what we’ve learned about the global supply chain disruption.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Peter S. GoodmanComputer chips. Exercise equipment. Breakfast cereal. By now, you’ve probably heard: The world has run short of a great many products.In an era in which we’ve become accustomed to clicking and waiting for whatever we desire to arrive at our doors, we have experienced the shock of not being able to buy toilet paper, having to wait months for curtains and needing to compromise on the color of our new cars.Of far greater importance, we have suffered a pandemic without adequate protective gear. Doctors cannot obtain needed medicines. In Alaska, people are struggling to find enough winter coats. Airplanes are delayed while crews wait for food deliveries.The pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of the global supply chain — that’s the usually invisible pathway of manufacturing, transportation and logistics that gets goods from where they are manufactured, mined or grown to where they are going. At the end of the chain is another company or a consumer who has paid for the finished product. Scarcity has caused the prices of many things to go higher.The disruptions go back to early last year, to the beginning stages of the pandemic. Factories in parts of the world where a lot of the globe’s manufacturing capacity sits — places like China, South Korea and Taiwan as well as Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam and European industrial giants like Germany — were hit hard by the spread of coronavirus cases. Many factories shut down or were forced to reduce production because workers were sick or in lockdown. In response, shipping companies cut their schedules in anticipation of a drop in demand for moving goods around the world.That proved to be a terrible mistake. Demand for some things — restaurant meals, trips to vacation destinations, spa services — indeed cratered.But Americans took the money they used to spend on such experiences and redirected it to goods for their homes, which were suddenly doubling as offices and classrooms. They put office chairs and new printers in their bedrooms, while adding gym equipment and video game consoles to their basements. They bought paint and lumber for projects that added space or made their existing confines more comfortable. They added mixers and blenders to their kitchens, as parents became short-order cooks for cooped-up children. The timing and quantity of consumer purchases swamped the system. Factories whose production tends to be fairly predictable ramped up to satisfy a surge of orders.Many did, but this produced its own troubles. Factories generally need to bring in components to make the things they export. For example, a computer assembled in China may require a chip made in Taiwan or Malaysia, a flat-panel display from South Korea and dozens of other electronics drawn from around the world, requiring specialized chemicals from other parts of China or Europe.The steep surge in demand clogged the system for transporting goods to the factories that needed them. At the same time, finished products — many of them made in China — piled up in warehouses and at ports throughout Asia because of a profound shortage of shipping containers, the standard-size steel boxes that carry goods on enormous vessels.In simplest terms, they got stuck in the wrong places. In the first phase of the pandemic, as China shipped huge volumes of protective gear like masks and hospital gowns all over the world, containers were unloaded in places that generally do not send much product back to China — regions like West Africa and South Asia. In those places, empty containers piled up just as Chinese factories were producing a mighty surge of other goods destined for wealthy markets in North America and Europe.Because containers were scarce and demand for shipping intense, the cost of moving cargo skyrocketed. Before the pandemic, sending a container from Shanghai to Los Angeles cost perhaps $2,000. By early 2021, the same journey was fetching as much as $25,000. And many containers were getting bumped off ships and forced to wait, adding to delays throughout the supply chain. Even huge companies like Target and Home Depot had to wait for weeks and even months to get their finished factory wares onto ships.Meanwhile, at ports in North America and Europe, where containers were arriving, the heavy influx of ships overwhelmed the availability of docks. At ports like Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif., dozens of ships were forced to anchor out in the ocean for days before they could load and unload. At the same time, truck drivers and dockworkers were stuck in quarantine, reducing the availability of people to unload goods and further slowing the process. This situation was worsened by the shutdown of the Suez ",Pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of the global supply chain. People are struggling to find enough winter coats for their homes.

As the president convened a supply-chain minisummit with allies on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meetings, administration officials also said the United States would send aid to Mexico and Central American nations to ease “disruptions and bottlenecks.” And they said Secretary of State Antony K. Blinken and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo would host an international summit on supply-chain challenges next year. The clogged flow of goods caused by the pandemic has triggered product shortages and rising consumer prices across the globe, and it has caused the president economic and political headaches at home. Mr. Biden has taken a wide rage of steps to try to help ease the pressures, but many of them, including the actions announced on Sunday, are unlikely to provide meaningful immediate relief. The meeting Mr. Biden hosted in Rome included 14 countries, White House officials said, among them China, a major supplier of goods to the United States. As the meeting began, Mr. Biden noted how easily the transport of goods was thrown into disarray by the pandemic. “We cannot go back to business as usual,” he said. “Coordination is key.”",President Biden announced an executive order allowing the federal government to release critical materials from its National Defense Stockpile.

It paid the bills, he said, and he could reduce his expenses if he lived mostly out of a truck.But over the years, the job strained his relationships. He was away from home for weeks at a time and could not prioritize his health: It took more than three years to schedule an optometry appointment, which he kept canceling because of his irregular work hours. He quit on Oct. 6.“I had no personal life outside of driving a truck,” said Mr. Gary, 58, a resident of Vancouver, Wash. “I finally had enough.”Truck drivers have been in short supply for years, but a wave of retirements combined with those simply quitting for less stressful jobs is exacerbating the supply chain crisis in the United States, leading to empty store shelves, panicked holiday shoppers and congestion at ports. Warehouses around the country are overflowing with products, and delivery times have stretched to months from days or weeks for many goods.A report released last month by the American Trucking Associations estimated that the industry is short 80,000 drivers, a record number, and one the association said could double by 2030 as more retire.Supply-chain problems stem from a number of factors, including an extraordinary surge in demand for goods and factory shutdowns abroad. But the situation has been compounded by a shortage of truckers and deteriorating conditions across the transportation sector, which have made it even harder for consumers to get the things they want when they want them.The phenomenon is rippling across the economy, weighing on growth, pushing up prices for consumers and depressing President Biden’s approval rating. But the White House has struggled with how to respond.On Tuesday, it announced a series of steps aimed at alleviating supply-chain problems, such as allowing ports to redirect other federal funds to efforts to ease backlogs. As part of the plan, the Port of Savannah could reallocate more than $8 million to convert existing inland facilities into five pop-up container yards in Georgia and North Carolina to help ships offload cargo more quickly.That followed an announcement by Mr. Biden last month that major ports and private companies would begin moving toward 24-hour operation in an effort to ease the gridlock. But early results suggest that trucking remains a major bottleneck in that effort, compounding congestion at the ports.The directors of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach said that, at least initially, few additional truckers were showing up to take advantage of the extended hours.The pandemic continues to impact the U.S. economy in a multitude of ways. One key factor to keep an eye on is the job market and how it changes as the economic recovery moves forward.Gene Seroka, the executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, said his port had told the White House in July that about 30 percent of the port’s appointments for truckers went unused every day, largely because of shortages of drivers, the chassis they use to pull the loads and warehouse workers to unload items from trucks.“Here in the port complex, with all this cargo, we need more drivers,” Mr. Seroka said.The $1 trillion infrastructure bill that the House passed last week could help mitigate the shortage. The legislation includes a three-year pilot apprenticeship program that would allow commercial truck drivers as young as 18 to drive across state lines. In most states, people under 21 can receive a commercial driver’s license, but federal regulations restrict them from driving interstate routes.But industry experts said the program was unlikely to fix the immediate problem, given that it could take months to get underway and the fact that many people simply do not want to drive trucks.Mr. Biden said last month that he would consider deploying the National Guard to alleviate the trucker shortage, although a White House official said the administration was not actively pursuing the move.Meera Joshi, the deputy administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, said the agency had focused on easing the process of obtaining a commercial driver’s license after states cut back licensing operations during the coronavirus pandemic. The agency has also extended the hours that certain drivers can work. “They are the absolute backbone of a big part of our supply chain,” Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, said about truckers at a White House briefing on Monday. “We need to respect and, in my view, compensate them better than we have.”The shor","Long hours are leading to a shortage of truck drivers, which has compounded shipping delays in the United States.

NYT,Supply chain,6,Britain’s economic recovery has slowed as supply disruptions persist.,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/business/britain-economy-recovery.html,"The British economy’s recovery slowed through the summer, delaying its return to its prepandemic size as supply shortages hampered businesses and exports declined.Gross domestic product grew 1.3 percent in the third quarter, down from 5.5 percent in the previous three months, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday. The growth was driven by spending on services, especially in hotels, restaurants and entertainment as the last of the major pandemic restrictions were lifted in July and people vacationed in the country. A return to in-person doctor appointments also boosted the growth data.But the recovery was weaker in other sectors. Retail sales fell as well as car sales because of the global shortage of semiconductors. Supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks have held back growth in Britain and are expected to last longer than previously anticipated. It’s a problem afflicting other countries, including Germany. There have been backups at Britain’s ports and difficulties distributing goods.The changes to migration and trade because of Brexit, including fewer European Union workers and a stricter customs regime, have exacerbated the supply bottlenecks, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, which provides independent forecasts for the British government.Exports fell nearly 2 percent over the previous quarter, partly because of a decline in the export of transport equipment and machinery.Britain’s “unique Brexit-related issues,” including additional customs paperwork, food safety checks and hurdles to tariff-free trade with the European Union, its biggest trading partner, “no doubt amplify the port and transport challenges,” Kallum Pickering, an economist at Berenberg Bank, wrote in a note to clients.The slowing momentum in the world’s recovery from the pandemic has led to downgrades of global and British growth forecasts. The Bank of England said last week that the British economy would grow 7 percent this year, reducing its forecast by a quarter percentage point. It cut a whole percentage point off growth for 2022 — to 5 percent — as supply disruptions are expected to weigh on the economy until late in the year and the annual inflation rate is forecast to climb to about 5 percent in the spring.The Bank of England said it would probably need to raise interest rates in the coming months as prices climbed, but it is waiting for more official data on what has happened in the labor market after the end of the government-sponsored furlough program in September. The central bank said that more than a million jobs were benefiting from the program as it ended and that there might be a small increase in unemployment now that those payments were over. The bank has to balance taming inflation without putting the recovery off course with tighter monetary policy.As the recovery is expected to continue to slow, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research warned this week that British households will be “painfully squeezed” as prices rise, fiscal stimulus is reduced and tax increases come into force in April. The London institution also said the number of households that can’t afford basic necessities could double because of a cut to a major government benefit program.","Gross domestic product grew 1.3 percent in the third quarter, down from 5.5 percent in the previous three months.

NYT,Supply chain,7,"Uneasy About the Economy, Americans Are Spending Anyway",https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/business/retail-sales-october.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes,"Retail sales jumped 1.7 percent in October, the third monthly increase, a rise that highlighted the resilience of the U.S. economy.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Ben Casselman, Sapna Maheshwari and Coral Murphy MarcosAmerican consumers are dour about the economy, worried about inflation and pessimistic about the direction of the country in general.But none of that is keeping them from spending.Retail sales set a record in October, before adjusting for inflation, as shoppers splurged on electronics and home-improvement projects. Major retailers like Walmart are posting strong profits. And Wall Street forecasters are predicting a holiday season that looks less like pandemic-constrained 2020 than like 2019, when a strong labor market powered robust sales.The continued strength of consumer spending reflects the resilience of the U.S. economy after a year and a half of disruptions, and the success of the government’s economic response in insulating many families from the damage. Households in the aggregate have trillions of dollars more in accumulated savings than before the crisis.But the heavy spending, particularly on goods rather than services, is also contributing to the economy’s problems, intensifying supply-chain snarls and shipping delays. That, in turn, is pushing up prices: Inflation in October hit its highest annual rate in more than three decades.“It’s the demand in the first place that’s causing prices to move higher,” said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist for Jefferies, an investment bank. “There is a supply shortage, but it’s not because of bottlenecks. It’s because we’ve had this big shock to aggregate demand and supply can’t respond quickly enough.”Those issues are doing little to dampen the fortunes of the country’s largest retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, both of which reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday that topped Wall Street’s expectations.Walmart in recent months began chartering ships to circumvent the shipping congestion and has been pushing to hire 150,000 workers ahead of the holidays. On Tuesday, the company said its inventory in the United States was 11.5 percent higher heading into the holiday season this year than last.“The holiday season is here, and we are ready,” Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive, said on a call with analysts.Consumers overall spent a record $638 million at stores and restaurants in October, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, up 1.7 percent from September and 21 percent above prepandemic levels. It was the biggest one-month gain since March, when the final round of government stimulus checks lifted spending.Inflation is eating up some of the increased spending. Sales at gasoline stations rose nearly 47 percent in October from a year earlier, the result of gas prices that are up roughly the same amount in that time. But overall, sales are rising faster than prices: Adjusted for inflation, retail sales were up 0.7 percent in October from the previous month, and up 9.5 percent from a year earlier.Krizzia Soto-Villanueva in Burlington, Vt., said she had been engaging in “retail therapy,” or shopping to make herself feel happier, after she realized she spent the last 18 months at home without spending much on herself. After she started a doctorate program at the University of Vermont and became a resident assistant in September, she decided to use her paycheck in the coming months to make up for what she didn’t spend before, buying clothes and hiking equipment.“I’m aware prices are going up, but I spent almost two years without spending money on myself,” Ms. Soto-Villanueva said. “I’m not going to spend all of my savings, but if I really want something, I’m not going to hesitate much.”Despite her free spending, Ms. Soto-Villanueva said she was “feeling a little pessimistic about the economy,” in part because she’s paying more for rent and utilities. She isn’t alone: The University of Michigan last week said that consumer sentiment fell sharply in early November and was lower than when the coronavirus outbreak was at its worst. The drop partly reflects partisan patterns — Republicans soured on the economy when President Biden took office — but even Democrats report being concerned about rising prices.The increase in inflation is partly a result of pandemic-induced shifts in how consumers are spending their money. Spending on goods — from groceries to cars to home-gym equipment — soared last year as people spent more time at home. That put extra pressure on supply chains already under stress from shutdowns at ports and factories around the world, leading to both product shortages and higher prices.Economists, including policymakers at the Federal Reserve, expected spending on goods to fall as the pandemic eased. So far, that hasn’t happened. The retail sales data showed growth in both online and in-person spending.“Everybody believed during 2021 ","Retail sales set a record in October, the third monthly increase, a rise that highlighted the resilience of the U.S. economy after a year",Supply chain problems?

The new infections come as two of the largest U.S. railroads last week restricted shipments from West Coast seaports to Chicago, where a surge of shipping containers has clogged rail yards.Supply headaches stretching from Asian factory towns to the American Midwest are intensifying as the economic recovery tries to outrun the highly infectious delta variant. Aftershocks from earlier limits on a major Chinese port following a rash of covid-19 cases are expected later this month to worsen backlogs at U.S. West Coast facilities.Chronic shipping delays also are feeding inflation, just as consumers prepare to stock up for the coming school year. Spot shortages of clothing and footwear could appear within weeks, and popular toys may be scarce during the holiday season. Even as the U.S. economy is slated to enjoy its fastest growth since 1984, supply lines now are expected to remain snarled through the first half of next year or longer, according to corporate executives.“Whatever the new normal is, it will happen a lot later than people assume,” Marc Bitzer, chief executive of Whirlpool, told analysts Thursday. “Everybody hopes for [the] new normal to be next quarter. It’s not going to be.”A rate rise in the U.S. might trigger big problems in the developing worldThe pandemic has exposed fragile global supply chains across multiple continents. No sooner did the recent reopening of southern China’s Yantian port solve one problem than the closure of Bangladeshi factories until Aug. 5 created another.White House economists say interruptions in the supply of semiconductors and home building materials are contributing to the highest inflation in 13 years. The president earlier this month signed an executive order designed to increase competition and lower prices in the shipping and freight rail markets, but any impact will be felt only in the long run.Corporations such as Levi Strauss, Harley-Davidson and Unilever are among those rewiring their supply lines or raising prices to offset higher input costs.But the Biden administration has parried industry calls to help companies financially by eliminating import tariffs on Chinese products or to use the National Guard to physically clear the cargo jam.“There are things that could be done if they took it seriously as a crisis,” said Rick Woldenberg, chief executive of Learning Resources, a maker of educational toys.The interruption of Chinese manufacturing at the pandemic’s outset toppled the first of several dominoes leading to today’s global supply chain pileup. While Chinese factories quickly returned to normal operations, an unexpected increase in American demand for goods during the work-from-home era discombobulated traditional trade patterns.As a result, ocean-spanning supply chains, the distinguishing characteristic of the age of globalization, are failing at multiple points.The massive cargo carriers that arrive off the coast of Southern California, some bearing more than 15,000 metal shipping containers, often must wait at anchor for days before disgorging their cargo.Once on land, containers frequently idle in temporary storage while awaiting space on an outbound truck or train, incurring additional costs.Inland rail yards have emerged as the latest pain point for companies trying to move goods internationally. Trains full of clothing, computers, furniture and appliances have been streaming for months into Midwestern hubs.When the system works as designed, containers are lifted from arriving trains and placed directly onto a wheeled chassis, which is then hauled away by a local driver. The chassis is quickly unloaded by the final customer and returned to the rail yard.But this year’s flood of cargo has overwhelmed the system, leaving the yards without enough chassis. So containers have piled up by the thousands.Rather than a single movement from train to truck, containers now are lifted off, placed in storage and then moved a second or even third time before eventually exiting the yard, according to Lawrence Gross, a transportation consultant in Durango, Colo.“Once you fall behind, it’s really hard to dig your way out,” Gross said. “The system has gotten out of whack.”Union Pacific, the nation’s largest publicly traded railroad, halted all eastbound traffic from the ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach, Oakland and Tacoma, starting July 19, for at least one week. BNSF Railway, which boasts one of North America’s largest freight rail network, said it was reducing the flow of containers from Los Angeles and Long Beach for two weeks in what it called “a somewhat unprecedented” move.Both railroads ha","Latest outbreak of cancerous cancels factory shutdowns in countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh.

""It's going to get worse again before it gets better"", said Brian Bourke, chief growth officer at SEKO Logistics. ""Global supply chains are not built for this. Everything is breaking down.""Fallout from the once-in-a-century health crisis is the chief culprit behind soaring freight bills and delivery delays. Americans trapped at home slashed spending at restaurants, movie theaters and sporting events and splurged on goods such as laptops and bicycles, triggering an import avalanche that has overwhelmed freight channels.But the pandemic also exposed weaknesses in the nation's transport plumbing: investment shortfalls at key ports, controversial railroad industry labor cuts, and a chronic failure by key players to collaborate, according to interviews with more than 50 individuals representing every link in the nation's supply chain.""It's like an orchestra with lots of first violins and no conductor. No one's really in charge"", said Fran Inman, a Los Angeles-based commercial real estate executive who has advised government agencies on supply issues.Port of Los AngelesOn Sept. 1, 40 container ships belonging to companies such as Hyundai, NYK Line and Evergreen were anchored off California, waiting for a berth.

Some vessels sit for two weeks or more, effectively cutting capacity on trans-Pacific shipping lanes and driving up costs.""From an economic point of view, it's a disaster because cargo is waiting,"" said Markus Grote, captain of a Hapag-Lloyd container ship.For goods to move seamlessly from overseas factories to American addresses, the oceangoing vessels, shipping containers, cargo terminals, truckers, chassis providers and railroads all must work together, like runners in a relay race. If equipment gets stuck at any point, delays ripple along the entire chain.[From ports to rail yards, global supply lines struggle amid virus outbreaks in the developing world]Yet the United States is ""decades behind"" foreign ports in getting carriers, terminals and shippers to provide each other access to commercial data for planning purposes, said Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles. Concerns over data privacy, business secrets and security have resulted in a fragmented approach. Individual ports operate as separate fiefdoms rather than as part of a national system.In the Dutch city of Rotterdam, Europe's largest port, everyone involved in a cargo vesselâs arrival sees the same information on a common data-sharing platform. Called ""PortXchange,"" the software makes port calls smarter and more efficient than the use of separate systems or the telephone, according to the port's website.Seroka touts a tool called the Port Optimizer, which forecasts three weeks of incoming cargo. More information sharing including over a longer time period would allow carriers, terminals, truckers and dockworkers to better position equipment and people. But other than Los Angeles, New Orleans is the only U.S. port that is even testing the system. Information sharing and additional transparency is one of the few areas where indisputably we could get more capacity out of the current system,â said Dan Maffei, chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission.To be sure, the United States is importing historic amounts of goods.

Some vessels wait two weeks for an unloading berth.Similar delays await freight once it reaches the shore, where docks, rail yards and warehouses are jammed with goods, the fruits of an economic recovery the administration boasts is robust.Administration officials promise a “90-day sprint” to clear a path for cargo. Several companies participating in the White House event, including Walmart, made “specific volume commitments” about containers they will remove from California docks. Leaders of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union have agreed to work longer hours, provided individual terminal operators pay up.Biden said today’s announcement had “the potential to be a game changer” in unclogging the nation’s supply lines.But the extended hours the administration is touting represent something less than the full around-the-clock operations that are typical of the world’s most advanced cargo-moving facilities.The Port of Long Beach, which makes up one half of the nation’s chief import gateway, began a pilot program last month of late-night and predawn work. An administration official said Tuesday that Long Beach had “already gone to 24-7″ and Los Angeles would be “meeting that effort.” But only one of the Long Beach port’s six container terminals works 24 hours a day, and it does so only Monday through Thursday, according to Noel Hacegaba, the port’s deputy executive director of administration and operations.Biden said the L.A. port, which is adjacent to the Long Beach facility, would be open for 60 additional hours each week. But Phillip Sanfield, a port spokesman, said he could not say how many L.A. terminals will now begin operating around-the-clock. And Gene Seroka, executive director of the L.A. port, said on Twitter that “operational details are being discussed and worked out with the supply chain stakeholders.”Some industry executives described the administration’s latest initiative, which the White House billed as “nearly doubling” the port’s cargo-handling hours, as incomplete. Matt Schrap, chief executive of the Harbor Trucking Association, whose members service the ports, said the measure will make a “big difference” only if terminals abandon requirements for truckers to return a specific type of empty shipping container before collecting a full one.And Craig Grossgart, senior vice president for global ocean at SEKO Logistics, said: “It will accomplish zero. It’s just window dressing.”Inside America’s broken supply chainIndeed, the administration said an additional 3,500 containers each week would move through the L.A. port during the new nighttime hours, thanks to promises from six companies — Walmart, FedEx, UPS, Target, Home Depot and Samsung.The port expects to process 79,289 containers this week, according to its website.The administration says the giant companies will set an example that will spur others to follow. But longer working hours at the neighboring ports, which operate as a single complex under dual management, will matter only if trains, trucks and warehouses all do the same. Already, truckers have been reluctant to show up at the Long Beach port during the 3 a.m.-to-7 a.m. slot known as the “hoot” shift — named for the hoot owl — because they have nowhere to take containers at that hour.Major railroads “have long been 24/7 operations,” said Ian Jefferies, president of the American Railroad Association.Supply headaches are posing a direct challenge to Biden’s hopes of a smooth economic recovery. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell has said that logistics headaches are responsible for inflation lasting longer than he expected.The mounting disruption, mirrored in multiple countries, is having an economic impact that extends beyond consumer and business irritation over delayed deliveries.

Ever since Frederick Taylor published “The Principles of Scientific Management” in 1911, companies have focused on doing things more quickly, and raising consumers’ expectations as a result.But Taylor’s ideas didn’t take into account the havoc a pandemic might do to supply chains — and how that would blunt what a few months ago seemed like a looming resumption of modern daily life’s zippy pace.Across the country, Americans’ expectations of speedy service and easy access to consumer products have been crushed like a Styrofoam container in a trash compactor. Time for some new, more realistic expectations.Fast food is less fast. A huge flotilla of container ships is stuck offshore in California, waiting to unload. Shelves normally stocked with Halloween candy this time of year are empty, as I saw the other day at a Target here in Ann Arbor, Mich.The issue has become so troublesome — with alarming economic and political ramifications — that the White House is stepping in, urging unions, port operators and big consumer-goods companies to work around the clock (if they aren’t already) to unclog supply pipelines.American consumers, their expectations pampered and catered to for decades, are not accustomed to inconvenience.A post shared by Washington Post Opinions (@postopinions)“For generations, American shoppers have been trained to be nightmares,” Amanda Mull wrote in August in the Atlantic, before the supply chain problem turned truly ugly. “The pandemic has shown just how desperately the consumer class clings to the feeling of being served.”Customers’ persistent whine, “Why don’t they just hire more people?,” sounds feeble in this era of the Great Resignation, especially in industries, such as food service, with reputations for being tough places to work.Rather than living constantly on the verge of throwing a fit, and risking taking it out on overwhelmed servers, struggling shop owners or late-arriving delivery people, we’d do ourselves a favor by consciously lowering expectations.I don’t know about where you live, but in Ann Arbor the luxury of blithely tapping on a phone and summoning a restaurant delivery that arrives in 45 minutes is over. There’s a shortage of food-delivery drivers nationwide. The sanity-preserving move is to assume an hour and half for delivery, and then a mere hour and 10 minutes is a pleasant surprise.“I understand people are getting frustrated, but it’s time for people to take a chill pill,” says Lisa McDonald, owner of TeaHaus, an Ann Arbor shop selling tea and gifts. “I’m just not going to have the things that I usually have. Maybe they aren’t going to get the purple mug, but the blue one is pretty, too.”The other day I found myself carrying home a loaf of bread in my bare hands because the bakery had run out of bags. Back when we didn’t know how good we had it — circa 2019 — I might have been annoyed by the inconvenience. Now I was just glad the bakery was still in business.Other Ann Arbor merchants have given me a glimpse of what it’s like on their side of the supply chain misery. Leyla Conlan, owner of the stationery shop The Write Touch by Leyla, says she recently returned from a gift trade show, where vendors were happy to take her orders but warned that they couldn’t promise the same delivery time as they had in the past. The reasons included factory slowdowns, shortages of packing materials and fewer truck drivers.Steve Mangigian, managing partner at Zingerman’s coffee and candy companies, tells me he used to order paper cups and lids for his baristas about six to eight weeks in advance. Now, the wait is 16 to 18 weeks — possibly longer. “If I can’t get cups to sell my product, what am I supposed to do? The supply chain could literally shut down my business.”I know Mangigian because I’ve been writing a book about Zingerman’s. It’s scheduled to be published in February. Everything seems on track, but the publishing industry hasn’t been immune to the supply chain snarls. Paper shortages, worker shortages and the traffic jams at shipping ports are endangering holiday books sales, according to CNN.All I can do is hope for the best. Like everybody else. And keep those expectations reasonable. Eventually the supply chain will get straightened out.American consumers might have been spoiled, but generations of them have also dealt with shortages of some kind — gasoline in the 1970s, food rationing in the 1940s, housing in the 1920s when cities such as Detroit were booming. Now it’s our turn to make adjustments.","The White House is stepping in, urging unions, ports and big consumer-goods to work around the clock.

The president’s public approval ratings have sagged in recent weeks as consumers soured on goods shortages and the highest inflation in 30 years.How to buy gifts in a supply chain crisisYet even as Biden took credit for the turnaround, industry groups and logistics specialists warned that a return to the smooth flow of goods that was typical before the pandemic remains a long way off.“It’s still a hot mess,” said Stephen Lamar, president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. “We have to dig ourselves out of a daunting hole to get a sense of anything like normalcy, and that’s going to take a long, long time.”Administration officials in recent weeks have steered supply chain participants toward coordinated action to clear clogged freight channels, including calling for round-the-clock dock work. And the mountains of freight marooned on wharves have slowly started to shrink.Inside America's Broken Supply ChainBut the goods pipeline won’t really operate normally until Americans return to their traditional spending patterns, abandoned amid the pandemic. And there is no sign such a shift is imminent. Likewise, some of the president’s policy remedies, including $17 billion in new port spending and potential antitrust moves against the three main shipping alliances, will take years to produce benefits.Disjointed supply chains have become a distinguishing feature of the global recovery, affecting each of 45 economies surveyed by Oxford Economics. Current disruptions are likely to peak before year’s end and “mostly ease” by the second half of next year, the investment firm said, citing falling shipping rates and signs that companies are succeeding in rebuilding depleted inventories.Spot rates to send containers from China to the U.S. West Coast have dropped 25 percent in less than three weeks, as the holiday cargo tide recedes, according to the Freightos index. But in a reminder of today’s unusual conditions, the current $14,185-per-container cost remains more than 10 times its pre-pandemic level.As supply hiccups escalated this summer, the White House formed a task force drawing on multiple Cabinet agencies and appointed a “ports envoy” to untangle the cargo jams.The cost of delayQuick improvements proved elusive, since the nation’s supply chain is almost entirely a private-sector enterprise. John Porcari, the president’s ports envoy, has focused on jawboning cargo carriers, terminal operators, port directors, trucking companies and retailers in hopes of producing a consensus on needed steps.The most visible progress came earlier this month following port officials’ threats to levy daily fines on containers left clogging the docks. Within weeks, dockworkers had whittled the 95,000 shipping containers blocking L.A. terminals’ work areas down to 71,000, according to Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles. The neighboring Long Beach facility saw similar gains.Citing significant improvement, the ports have now delayed implementation of the fines until Monday. But carriers, which face potential multimillion-dollar penalties, are hounding customers to collect their goods.“They send me an email every day. They’ve put on a lot of pressure,” said Craig Grossgart, senior vice president for Seko Logistics. “It’s very consistent. Every single day without fail.”Dockworkers also are clearing space by shifting containers full of out-of-season goods, like patio furniture, to lots near the water, including a mothballed L.A. terminal once used for coal exports. Many of these containers would have occupied truck trailers, known as chassis, which now are free to transport other goods.Fewer boots, more slippers: How a shortage of shipping containers is changing what shows up on shelves“That’s going to improve the overall fluidity,” said Val Noel, chief operations officer for Trac Intermodal, a chassis provider.Yet even as loaded containers are moving out, empty containers bound for Asia are moving in. Cargo carriers have deployed a handful of dedicated vessels known as “sweepers” to retrieve thousands of empties. But the ships are much smaller than the typical container ship arriving from China and can only make a dent in the growing container pile.More than 100,",President Biden cited progress in moving shipping containers off the California coast and a decline in spot rates for ocean cargo.

WP,Supply chain,8,FTC demands info from top companies including Amazon and Walmart in sweeping supply chain probe,https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/11/29/ftc-supply-chain-inquiry/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=wp_main,"The Federal Trade Commission on Monday ordered nine large U.S. companies, including Walmart, Amazon and Procter & Gamble, to provide detailed information about their operations, in a bid to unravel the causes of the supply chain disruptions that are clouding the economic recovery. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)The commission order, approved by a 4-0 vote, came as President Biden met at the White House with corporate chieftains in the latest display of presidential concern over supply chain snarls. The president was scheduled to speak after the meeting with the chief executives of companies such as Food Lion, Mattel and Best Buy. But the White House rescheduled his comments for Wednesday, saying the president wanted to spend more time with the CEOs.While the FTC move will do nothing to ease the economy’s current bottlenecks, it could shape future regulatory actions intended to maintain or increase the amount of competition in key industries, according to antitrust specialists.The White House and some independent analysts have blamed a lack of competition throughout the supply chain for many of the current problems, which are fueling inflation and depressing the president’s public approval ratings. Biden this summer issued an executive order calling for regulators to crack down on consolidation in the ocean shipping and freight rail industries as part of a broader competition initiative.“We’ve had an incredible amount of consolidation in the supply chain. ... That’s why it’s been unable to withstand the kind of shock we’ve seen with the pandemic,” said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute. “We are now learning the hard way what 40 years of unbridled consolidation and lax merger enforcement mean.”As supply lines strain, some companies rewrite production playbookFTC Chair Lina Khan said the goal of the commission study is to “shed light on market conditions and business practices that may have worsened” the supply jams that were the focus of Monday’s White House event.In recent weeks, top administration officials have worked to hammer out agreements among ocean carriers, port executives, terminal operators and trucking companies to smooth tangled supply lines. At the neighboring ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, longshore workers have made headway clearing out some of the tens of thousands of shipping containers that have been crowding the docks.Yet other problems, including stacks of empty containers bound for Asia, continue to hobble operations.The FTC launched the supply chain probe using its authority to conduct wide-ranging studies without a specific law enforcement purpose. Such efforts can uncover information that would lead officials to open an investigation or could reshape their enforcement strategy.In the early 2000s, after repeatedly failing in efforts to block proposed hospital mergers, the FTC launched a Section 6b study, which enabled the commission to thwart future combinations.The commission is an independent agency that shares responsibility for antitrust enforcement with the Department of Justice and can crack down on deceptive business practices that harm consumers.A commission spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.With its supply chain probe, the commission will need to distinguish between price increases that reflect the workings of supply and demand and those that result from improper business links, said a former FTC official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the commission’s work.FTC lawyers will review information gathered from the individual companies, looking for indications that producers and wholesalers may have contractual arrangements that favor large retailers over their smaller rivals, the former official said.“They’re trying to see if there are things gumming up the works,” the former official added.Inside America's Broken Supply ChainAlong with Walmart, Amazon and P&G, commission orders for information are being sent to Kroger Co., C&S Wholesale Grocers Inc., Associated Wholesale Grocers Inc., McLane Co., Tyson Foods Inc. and Kraft Heinz Co.The CEOs of Kroger and Walmart participated in the White House session with the president a few hours before the FTC sent them its order.The commission is seeking information from consumer product makers, wholesalers and retailers. Under the Nov. 29 action, the nine companies have 45 days to provide internal documents, including details of their supply-chain strategies; pricing; marketing and promotions; costs; profit margins; selection of suppliers and brands; and their market shares.“In addition to better understanding the reasons behind the disruptions, the study will examine whether supply chain disruptions are leading to specific bottlenecks, shortages, anti-competitive practices, or contributing to rising consumer prices,” the FTC said in a statement.",The Federal Commission on Monday ordered nine large U.S. companies to provide detailed information about their operations. The commission's order comes as President Biden,"I think decision-makers at the time knew this would be a problem downstream. Their considered decision was to make hay while the sun shines.

Lawmakers on Friday passed a $1 trillion infrastructure package that Biden chaperoned after months of torturous negotiations.Baltimore's port is one of the nation's busiest, and it is set to benefit from billions of dollars that the bill has set aside for ports alone.Port congestion is one of the major issues. Goods ordered months ago from abroad wait at sea to be unloaded and transported inland.Issues like those have turned Biden's White House into an economic emergency response team. Biden on Tuesday talked to companies including Walmart and UPS to ensure they are ready for demand to skyrocket during the Christmas holiday rush. His aides worked with the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to move goods around the clock.The infrastructure package includes $17 billion in investments to help ports, including dredging to allow for larger ships and capacity expansion.The Port of Baltimore imports and exports more autos, farm machinery and construction equipment than any other U.S. port. It employs more than 15,300 people.Economic concerns have created political issues for Biden. The Democratic president has seen his popularity sag in recent months. His party is looking ahead to the 2022 mid-term elections, when they must defend their thin congressional majorities.Now, Biden is trying to close a deal on a roughly $1.75 trillion proposal to expand the country's social safety net and fight climate change.Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat who holds a virtual veto over Biden's agenda given narrow congressional margins, said on Wednesday that politicians ""can no longer ignore the economic pain Americans feel every day.""Manchin has previously expressed concern that the new spending bill could exacerbate inflation, a notion disputed by White House officials and a number of independent economists.","President Joe Biden says reversing inflation is ""a top priority for me"" New data shows inflation rose 6.2% in the 12 months through October",The Great Depression is down the road,Shelves stocked as long as you are willing to pay 50% more!,Positive Trust,Negative Fear,Biden launches policies to handle supply chain

The period includes October, when some consumers began early shopping for the all-important holidays. Walmart's tight margins could continue into the rest of the festive season, analysts said.Supply chain issues or inflation could see Walmart down 10-30 basis points on its fourth-quarter gross margin rate in the United States, said Evercore's Greg Melich.""The long period of sustained demand for goods has stretched supply chains, resulting in out of stocks and inflation,"" Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said.Walmart's results come weeks after rival ecommerce giant Amazon reported an underwhelming fourth-quarter outlook and warned of higher costs during the holiday period.  read more Inflation and a labor shortage have rippled through America, forcing retailers to raise wages and hand out hefty bonuses.

""If we start to see labor rates move up because of inflation, Walmart's one of the ones we wouldn't want to be around.""Walmart kept prices low to draw shoppers into stores in the third quarter. With more than 5,000 U.S. stores, the discounter's size and leverage with consumer product companies allow it to sell goods at lower prices, a key advantage when U.S. inflation is at a 30-year high.HOLIDAY RUSHIncreased contributions from its advertising business helped offset some of the supply-chain pressure on margins, the company said. Retailers are aggressively chasing consumer brands' ad dollars, touting the wealth of their shopper data and prime media space on their websites and in stores.Walmart said it expects full-year U.S. same-store sales to be more than 6% higher versus its prior forecast of a 5% to 6% rise, in anticipation of a surge in demand for toys and apparel during the holidays. Adjusted profit is expected to be around $6.40 per share, up from a previous range of $6.20 to $6.35.In the third quarter, sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 9.2%, excluding fuel, benefiting from higher grocery demand and people buying more at stores. Analysts had estimated a gain of 7.04%, according to Refinitiv data.Walmart's international business grew about 10% excluding the impact of currency fluctuations and divestitures, benefiting from strong sales in China and at India's Flipkart that got a big push from its promotional event ahead of the local festival of Diwali.Total revenue grew by a better-than-expected 4.3% to $140.53 billion and on an adjusted basis it earned $1.45 per share, 5 cents above Wall Street expectations.","Retailers, including Amazon, have been struggling to bring products into U.S. ahead of peak shopping season.

WASHINGTON, Nov 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Joe Biden can look in the mirror for answers to supply-chain dilemmas. The U.S. president wants to ease bottlenecks but some of his own policies stand in the way. Competing goals mean there are no quick fixes to rising consumer prices  read more .A surge in consumer demand along with production and logistical slowdowns due to Covid-19 have crippled the ability to create and move goods around the globe. On Monday, a record 170 vessels, including 114 container ships, were hanging around ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach, according to Marine Exchange of Southern California.Some simple fixes could help. Chinese manufacturers make equipment that move containers at ports, for example, and are the majority supplier to the United States. But in Biden’s efforts to push for fairer trade with China , his administration has imposed punitive tariffs on such products.That has caused prices to rise on such goods, which were already scarce. Though Biden and China’s leader Xi Jinping had a friendly meeting on Monday night, smiles are little more than a photo-opportunity. Biden ran his campaign on a platform of being tough on China, and rolling back tariffs without concessions on state subsidies or other practices would make him look weak.The White House’s push to contain Covid-19  read more  may also be damaging. Companies with at least 100 workers, along with federal contractors, have to ensure employees are fully vaccinated or get regularly tested by January. Yet businesses are already struggling to hire workers. There were 589,000 job openings in the transportation and warehouse sector in September, according to the Labor Department. The vaccine mandate includes broad exceptions for commercial truck drivers but the American Trucking Associations were worried enough to sue the Biden administration over the rule.Unions, too, are creating a problem. A contract between the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which covers dock workers, and the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents terminal operators, expires in July. The last such talks about six years ago led to work stoppages and months of disruptions, and labor has even more negotiating power now.Biden has taken a siloed approach to creating policies that in aggregate have the unfortunate consequence of making supply chain issues worse. Unlike his predecessor Donald Trump, Biden hasn’t cozied up to business leaders. That’s part of the reason why the administration is playing catch up in containing logistical logjams, with American consumers paying the price.Follow @GinaChon on TwitterCONTEXT NEWS- U.S. President Joe Biden on Nov. 15 held a signing ceremony for a bipartisan infrastructure plan to spend about $1 trillion to improve roads and bridges.

CNN,Supply chain,1,Boris Johnson's Brexit choices are making Britain's fuel and food shortages worse,https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/28/business/brexit-fuel-food-shortages/index.html?utm_content=2021-09-29T10%3A41%3A06&utm_term=link&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twCNN,"Rising energy bills, higher prices and a critical shortage of workers leading to food and fuel supply constraints are threatening to stall Britain's recovery from the pandemic.The crises afflicting the UK economy have sparked talk in newspapers and among politicians of a looming ""winter of discontent,"" a reference to the wave of strike action in 1978-79 that brought the British economy to its knees. There's even talk of stagflation, the nightmare combination of stagnant growth and high inflation.Although shortages, supply chain delays and rising food and energy costs are affecting several major economies, including the United States, China and Germany, Britain is suffering more than most because of Brexit.Specifically, the form of Brexit pursued by the UK government — which introduced stringent immigration policies and took Britain out the EU market for goods and energy, making it much harder for British companies to hire European workers and much more costly for them to do business with the country's single biggest trading partner. It didn't have to be this way — there were other options for a future EU-UK relationship. Worker shortages, for example, were not an inevitable outcome of Brexit, nor was going it alone on energy. But in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ideological rush to ""get Brexit done"" amid fraught negotiations with the European Union, agreements in several crucial areas, including energy, were sidelined.The UK government's post-Brexit immigration system, meanwhile, was designed to reduce the numbers of unskilled workers coming to Britain and end what the government described as the country's ""reliance on cheap, low-skilled labor,"" despite a domestic unemployment rate in the region of just 5%.""Ultimately, the government made a political decision to make low-skilled immigration more difficult,"" said Joe Marshall, a senior researcher at the Institute for Government, an independent think tank. ""Labor shortages may have been less severe if the UK had retained free movement of people post-Brexit,"" he added.Britain had a record 1 million job vacancies between June and August, according to the Office for National Statistics. Restaurants, pubs and supermarkets, including Nando's, had to temporarily close some locations last month due to staff shortages or because certain ingredients weren't delivered as a result of fewer truck drivers.The adult social care sector also faces a ""workforce crisis"" and will need to recruit overseas workers to fill tens of thousands of vacancies, according to Care England, which represents independent providers. Supply chain constraints exacerbated by Brexit means that UK consumers are facing surging food and energy bills at the same time that pandemic support measures are being unwound, including government support for wages and a £20 ($27) weekly uplift to social security payments.Truck driver shortageThis week the UK government was forced to partly back track on its stringent post-Brexit immigration policy after thousands of gas stations ran dry over the weekend and food retailers warned that the country had just 10 days to ""save Christmas.""In an interview with broadcasters on Tuesday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps acknowledged that Brexit ""no doubt will have been a factor"" in contributing to the fuel supply crisis. To ease the pressure, the government will issue temporary visas to 10,500 foreign truck drivers and poultry industry workers. But industry groups say the measure won't make much difference, in part because it's unclear whether EU workers want to come back to a country that's become more hostile to their presence.""The UK is unlikely to be attractive to foreign drivers [who] have understandably elected to be with their families because of a combination of Covid and Brexit,"" said Tim Doggett, CEO of the Chemical Business Association, whose members have also experienced shortages of vital materials. ""In addition, conditions of services and roadside facilities for drivers are better [in Europe],"" he added.British Chambers of Commerce President Ruby McGregor-Smith said that even if short-term visas attract the maximum numbers allowed, ""it will not be enough to address the scale of the problem that has now developed in our supply chains."" She likened it to ""throwing a thimble of water on a bonfire.""The UK military is now preparing to help deliver fuel amid warnings from the British Medical Association that healthcare workers, including ambulance drivers, won't be able to do their jobs as pumps run dry, although the Petrol Retailers Association has said that there are ""early signs that the crisis at pumps is ending.""The shortage of drivers has been exacerbated by Brexit, which resulted in tens of thousands of EU nationals leaving trucking jobs and other occupations in the United Kingdom. Johnson's decision to end the free movement of workers following Brexit has also made it more difficult for Europeans who had returned home during the pandemic to come back.Whil","Britain is suffering more than most because of the pandemic that brought the pandemic to the UK. There's even talk of a looming ""winter",The big thing that needs to happen is to make sure the hardship falls on those that voted Brexit - they need to pay for this.,Countries that reject immigration and embrace nationalism seem to be having the most problems filling jobs.

Adding to the problem is a shortage of workers needed to unload and transport the products from the ships to warehouses and distribution centers.Many stores won't be able to get the merchandise that should have already arrived for the start of the holiday shopping spree. And when stores do sell out of items they have, they risk staying out-of-stock on those items for much longer than usual. The inventory constraints means stores have less incentive to offer deals on the products they have.Macy's (M) executives, speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference last month, said the retailer has already been leaner with its discounts this year because of tighter inventory, which has helped boost its profits.""From a promotional standpoint, this year's promotional levels have been lower than historical levels, and we've been thoughtful about the categories that need promotion and we'll continue to do so,"" Macy's chief financial officer Adrian Mitchell, said during the conference.Women's clothing chain J. Jill (JILL) also signaled less robust discounting in the coming weeks.""Supply chain disruption is increasing, resulting in both elevated shipping costs and delays,"" J.Jill's chief financial officer, Mark Webb, said during the retailer's most recent earnings call with analysts in September. Although the company is working with its suppliers to expedite shipments, Webb said he expects those disruptions to continue in the next several weeks. He added that the retailer was focused on offsetting higher costs resulting from supply chain pressures by being less promotional and selling products at full price. Steve Lawrence, chief merchandising officer of sporting goods chain Academy Sports + Outdoors, also told CNN Business that shoppers will see fewer deep discounts during this year's holiday season.""There's been a lot less promotions in the marketplace because there has been a shortage of supply....Last year was not very promotional. We don't think that this holiday is going to be terribly promotional either,""  said Lawrence.Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow, in a note this month, said retailers in September were offering fewer promotions than they were at the same time last year going into the holiday shopping period.""Clearance activity once again dipped in September likely driven by supply chain issue,"" Boruchow wrote in the note.

CNN,Supply chain,3,How Biden's infrastructure bill could help prevent the next supply chain crisis,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/21/politics/supply-chain-crisis-biden-infrastructure-bill/index.html?utm_content=2021-10-21T17%3A45%3A12&utm_term=link&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twCNN,"There's no quick fix for the current pandemic-induced supply chain crisis, but the bipartisan infrastructure bill currently held up in Congress would help prepare the complicated system to handle the next disruption.The legislation calls for major federal investments in each step of the US freight network: Inland waterways and rail used for transporting goods and produce, highways and bridges traveled heavily by truck drivers as well as the nation's seaside ports, the biggest of which is currently facing a record backlog of shipping containers sitting on scores of ships waiting off the coast.Altogether, the bill would provide up to $78 billion over five years to address the interconnected system that moves freight across the country, according to the Coalition for America's Gateways and Trade Corridors that advocates for the nation's freight infrastructure. The new investment would provide a 40% increase to two key federal freight infrastructure programs as well as additional money for new programs.Chronic underfunding""The money is very much needed for a backlog of projects across the country,"" said Elaine Nessle, the coalition's executive director.""These projects stay on the books until we have enough money and the needs keep piling on as consumers buy more goods and add stress on the system,"" Nessle added. Experts in the industry have long been sounding the alarm about weaknesses in the infrastructure system that transports goods and produce across the country and the lack of funding to address them. The demand for government grants, for example, exceeds the current available funding. A Department of Transportation grant fund known as the INFRA program received 157 applications this year but could only award money to 24 of them. The infrastructure needs range in scope. Rails need upgrades and bridges need repairs. Expanding locks along the Mississippi River would help accommodate larger barges and move more cargo at a quicker pace. Changes along roadways heading away from ports are desperately needed to improve traffic flow. Pandemic highlights existing problemsToday's supply chain crisis largely stems from the pandemic, which caused major changes in Americans' buying habits. Consumers stuck at home started spending more on goods than services and the sudden spike in purchasing combined with a shortage of workers -- especially truck drivers -- was enough to topple the delicate system. As a result, shipping costs are skyrocketing and threatening to keep inflation elevated. Economists say the supply chain problems are showing no signs of slowing and could last into next year. But the current backup is shining a bright light on problems that existed long before the pandemic, and suddenly making households keenly aware of how important the system is to putting food on their tables and holiday gifts on store shelves. ""The pandemic is sort of a unique situation, but in a sense it's what people have been warning about,"" said Chuck Baker, president of the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association. The 600 different short railroad lines across the United States help connect a lot of rural areas directly to the national railroad network and can be more efficient than trucks. They are typically privately owned, expensive to operate and could benefit greatly from a boost in federal funding, said Baker, noting it could help update the tracks and, for some, ""help stay in existence.""Waiting on CongressPresident Joe Biden's infrastructure plan -- which would invest $1.3 trillion over five years -- passed the Senate in August with 19 Republican votes. But it has yet to come up for a vote in the House, where progressive Democrats want to tie it to a larger spending bill. That piece of legislation would take up the remaining parts of Biden's agenda that are unlikely to garner Republican support but could be passed without their votes using a legislative process known as reconciliation. That spending plan, which calls for investing $1.9 trillion over 10 years, would expand the country's social safety net by making child care more affordable and creating a universal pre-K program that could help parents who left the workforce during the pandemic. It would provide paid and sick leave benefits and expand Medicare so that it includes vision coverage, among several other provisions. It would also likely raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Democratic leaders have pressed lawmakers to have an agreement before October 31 in order to move the infrastructure bill before the short-term surface transportation funding bill expires.

The company also raised its annual sales and profit growth, a signal that it's expecting a strong holiday shopping stretch.Walmart (WMT) on Tuesday said sales at US stores open for at least one year increased 9.2% during the three months ending October 31 compared with the same period a year ago. The company raised its full-year sales guidance, expecting sales to come in above 6% for the year.Walmart's stock was down slightly during early trading Tuesday.Despite supply chain snarls and rising prices, Americans are still spending heading into the holidays. Walmart's sales were aided last quarter by government stimulus payments to consumers and higher prices on items such as groceries, chief financial officer Brett Biggs said on a call with analysts.  On Tuesday, the Commerce Department said that retail sales rose 1.7% in October, beating economists' expectations and jumping sharply from September.Walmart has used its enormous size and clout to navigate supply chain and inflationary pressures.Several large retail chains, including Walmart, have chartered their own ships to deliver goods from Asia, stocked up on extra merchandise and relied on their deep pockets and broad supplier bases to adjust to supply constraints. Those options are too expensive and inaccessible for most small shops, which typically have less financial flexibility to absorb higher costs and keep prices down for customers than large competitors.""We've got so many suppliers to choose from,"" CEO Doug McMillon said on the call, adding that Walmart has ""lots of flexibility"" on setting prices for items such as clothing and groceries.Although many stores are struggling to get products, Walmart's inventory levels increased 11.5% last quarter from with the year prior as the company stocked up in anticipation of the holiday stretch.""The company's inventory levels appear to be in good shape ahead of the all-important holiday,"" Chuck Grom, an analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors, said in a note to clients.Analysts also expect higher levels of inflation to benefit discount chains such as Walmart as customers increasingly look for ways to save money on food, gas and other goods.","Sales at US stores open for at least one year increased 9.2% in October.

Their larger competitors such as Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Costco (COST), Home Depot (HD) and others were able to stay open.With smaller retailers closed and spending on travel and leisure at a standstill, these major chains boomed as Americans stocked up on groceries, household basics, office supplies and furniture during stay-at-home mandates.Meanwhile, the pandemic caused roughly 200,000 more small businesses to close in the first year of the pandemic than in a typical year, the Federal Reserve estimated.As independent shops began reopening in the second half of 2020 and early 2021, they met a new set of challenges: manufacturing shutdowns and material shortages that made it harder to get products and keep them in stock, higher costs for shipping and transportation, as well as difficulties hiring and retaining workers.All retailers have grappled with these problems this year. But the challenges have hit independent stores harder, experts say. Mom-and-pop owners are typically lowest on the priority list for manufacturers and shipping companies when shortages or delays pop up.Home Depot, for example, said last week that some vendors with limited supplies told the chain that they're giving the company priority over others: ""'We can't service the industry, so we'd rather focus on the best partner,"" the suppliers said, Home Depot chief operating officer Edward Decker recalled on a call with analysts last week.Small stores also usually lack the financial flexibility to manage higher costs and hold prices down for customers, unlike large competitors that can use their scale and extensive resources to absorb cost increases.""Bigger retailers should be more able to navigate supply chain issues and have better in stocks than smaller retailers without the muscle,"" said Michael Baker, a retail analyst at D.A. Davidson, in a note to clients last week.The gap between big and small retailersSales are expected to boom this holiday, but small stores may miss out as shoppers head to cheaper chains with more goods on their shelves.Retail sales in November and December will grow between 8.5% and 10.5% this year compared with the 2020 holiday season, to a record of up to $859 billion, projects the National Retail Federation, an industry trade group.Large chains' inventories have ballooned ahead of the holidays thanks in part to tactics that are way too costly for most shop owners — chartering ships and airfreighting products to the United States from overseas, for example. Big retailers have also been relying on their broad supplier networks to mitigate shortages of raw materials and factory shutdowns. Small stores typically only have a handful of suppliers, so if something goes wrong with one of them, they're stuck.Target is ""well positioned"" on key holiday products such as toys and gifts, the retail giant's chief operating officer John Mulligan said on an earnings call last week. This will help Target ""continue to take market share as we go through the holiday season.""Retail giants are pulling out all the stops this holiday stretch to stockpile goods, hold prices down for customers, and staff stores and warehouses. But independent stores are struggling to to keep up.According to a recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, a lobbying group for small businesses, 39% of small business owners reported in October that supply chain disruptions have had a significant impact on their business. Another 29% reported a moderate impact. Only 10% reported no impact from supply chain disruptions.""Small business owners are attempting to take advantage of current economic growth but remain pessimistic about business conditions in the near future,"" said NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg in a statement.The lack of workers for unfilled jobs and inventory shortages are some of the top challenges for small businesses, he said, and will ""continue to be a problem during the holiday season.""It all means that, by the end of the holidays, it's likely that the gap between America's largest stores and its smallest will have stretched even further.","The pandemic caused 200,000 more small businesses to close in the first year of the pandemic.

The following month, war broke out in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas between Russian-allied separatists and Ukraine’s military.More than 13,000 people have been killed in the fighting since then, according to the United Nations. The last bout of large-scale combat was more than four years ago, but there have been periodic exchanges of artillery fire along a front line that has barely budged.Russia’s sudden military surge appears to be more about sending messages than launching a fresh offensive, analysts said.For Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukraine’s warm relations with the United States and Europe are a challenge to Moscow’s influence in the region, especially as Biden has vowed to take a harder line with the Kremlin. Ukraine’s aspirations of joining NATO are also seen by Russia as a potential threat on its doorstep.Opinion: How Russia’s military activity near Ukraine is poised to test the Biden administrationSome of the Russian military moves have a long-term feel. Russian troops and military hardware are at a recently constructed camp near Voronezh, about 155 miles from the Ukrainian border, according to the Moscow-based Conflict Intelligence Team, which monitors Russia’s military and security services.Russia also is relocating the 56th Guards Air Assault Brigade to Feodosia in Crimea.“Russia is testing everyone’s nerves and declaring its position: It should remain an important player for other countries, both the United States and Ukraine,” said Ruslan Leviev, an analyst with the Conflict Intelligence Team.“They are trying to show that Russia will not tolerate any sanctions or other actions put in place to pressure them to return Crimea to Ukraine or to change the course of things in Donbas,” he added.The Russian military began the shift about a month ago, Leviev said. At first, the redeployment was thought to be part of planned exercises. But when the maneuvers ended in late March, the military array stayed.Tanks have crossed the bridge connecting Russia and Crimea. Trains carrying military hardware from northern Russian regions have made multiple trips, Leviev said.Russia’s Ministry of Defense has also said  it is moving more than 10 naval vessels, including landing boats and artillery warships, from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea, which lines Ukraine’s coast, for “exercises.” And it has all happened in the open.The Conflict Intelligence Team has flagged about 150 videos, mainly from TikTok, showing the Russian military on the move. “It feels like the Russian Ministry of Defense wants these convoys and trains to be filmed,” Leviev said.“Because then the message about muscle-flexing and the costs of playing with its power will reach Ukraine and Western countries through the media,” he added.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia “is moving troops within its own territory at its own discretion, and this shouldn’t concern anyone.”Ukraine’s post-election message to White House: Leave us out of U.S. political feudsSerhii Deineko, the head of the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service, estimated that at least 85,000 Russian troops are positioned between six and 25 miles from the Ukrainian border and in Crimea.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that Russia now has more troops on Ukraine’s eastern border than at any time since 2014.“We’ve asked Russia for an explanation of these provocations,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters, “but more importantly, what we have signaled with our Ukrainian partners is a message of reassurance.”One senior U.S. official said Russia’s troop movements could further set back efforts to work with Moscow on areas of mutual interest, including talks to reverse a Trump-era withdrawal from the Open Skies Treaty, an international pact that U.S. allies have argued allows for valuable transparency and dialogue between Moscow and Washington. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive U.S.-Russia issues.In an April 2 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Biden pledged “unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s ongoing aggression,” according to the White House readout.

WP,Ukraine-Russia,2,Perspective: Ukraine wants to join NATO. Letting it in would just provoke Russia.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/06/16/nato-expansion-ukraine-strategic-error/?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social,"On his trip to Europe this week, President Biden faced a question that he probably would have preferred to avoid: Should Ukraine be invited to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and thereby receive a promise of mutual security from the United States as well as NATO’s other 29 members? (Biden responded that “it remains to be seen” whether this would happen but that Ukraine would have to meet certain criteria, including reducing corruption.)Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, pressed Biden for a yes-or-no answer about the country’s bid in an interview with reporters. Several U.S. senators in the United States have again started to push the idea, which was first raised formally during the George W. Bush presidency — specifically at the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania. The issue is undoubtedly often on the mind of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Biden is scheduled to meet with on Wednesday.Inviting Ukraine to join NATO would be a significant strategic mistake. Bringing that nation — or another former Soviet republic, such as Georgia — into the alliance would not improve European security. Quite the contrary. It was one thing to offer membership to former members of the Warsaw Pact such as Poland (which joined in 1999) and even to former Soviet republics such as the Baltic states (2004); they had never been recognized by Washington as part of the U.S.S.R. It would be another thing entirely, and not a close call in terms of strategic wisdom, to include countries whose history and geography and people are so intertwined with those of Russia.As the Greek historian Thucydides told us, human beings often go to war over pride. And few things could wound Russian pride more than this proposal for NATO expansion into the heart of the former Soviet space. Russia would surely respond with hostility — perhaps with deniable covert attacks that would make it hard for NATO to decide whether to respond yet leave Ukraine and/or Georgia at risk.China’s rise is exactly the kind of threat NATO exists to stopOf course, Moscow has no right to dictate events near its borders at the expense of its neighbors. There can be no “Yalta II,” whereby the great powers in effect divvy up Europe into respective spheres of influence, as happened at the end of World War II. The countries of Eastern Europe are fully sovereign and deserve every right to make their own domestic and foreign policy decisions. We in the West also owe a certain debt to Ukraine, which aided in global nonproliferation efforts when it gave up its nearly 2,000 nuclear warheads after the breakup of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s (in exchange for security guarantees from the United States, Britain, Russia and other countries — guarantees Russia has violated). That is why Ukraine deserves every right to join any other organization it wishes, should it qualify. For its part, Georgia has contributed troops in several difficult U.S.-led military missions over the past 20 years, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We owe them gratitude and help. But NATO membership is not the optimal tool for providing such help.We need a new vision for Eastern European security. Our goal should be permanent nonalignment for Ukraine and Georgia, as well as Belarus and other countries that are not within NATO, such as Armenia and Azerbaijan, provided that Moscow make verifiable promises to end its aggression against its neighbors and allow them to join other organizations such as the European Union if they someday qualify. Regions such as the Donbas in Ukraine, where Russia has supported separatist violence since 2014, should gain a certain autonomy but remain within their current national borders. (Crimea, which Russia took from Ukraine in 2014, may need to be finessed; it is not clear there is a workable solution on this matter.) If Russia supports these ideas and implements them consistently, it should then benefit from a lifting of most Western sanctions.NATO, an organization originally created by 12 countries bordering the North Atlantic region that grew to 16 by the Cold War’s end, is large enough already. It has nearly doubled in membership since the Berlin Wall fell. It is often mistakenly viewed at least as much as a tool of democracy promotion globally rather than one intended to preserve core Western security interests. Rather than enlarge it even more, with predictable and indeed inevitable consequences for the U.S.-Russia relationship, we need a new vision for this part of Eurasia.

For weeks, senior U.S. and European officials have warned Russian President Vladimir Putin to pull back what looks ominously like an invasion force — or face harsh consequences from a U.S.-led coalition.The warning message hasn’t connected. Instead, Putin seems to be relishing the West’s anxiety. He claimed Thursday that the United States and its allies were ignoring Russia’s “red lines” and “escalating the situation” with shows of force. He said he hoped the recent “tension” in Western statements about Ukraine would “remain as long as possible,” so that Russia’s views would be taken seriously. Putin’s goal seems to be restoration of Moscow’s Soviet-era hegemony over Kyiv.Nearly 100,000 Russian troops have massed along the border, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This faceoff continued Thursday. U.S. officials didn’t detect any change in the Russian military presence, up or down.There are nearly daily skirmishes in the contested Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops. The conflict could escalate if Russia sends “humanitarian” aid convoys into the region under a decree issued Monday by Putin. Ukraine has recently augmented its defense of the Donbass, using Turkish drones to combat pro-Russian rebels — and drawing a protest from Moscow.The Biden administration appears caught between its desire to deter a Russian invasion and its hope for new talks with Putin about strategic stability and other topics. National security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke by phone with his Russian counterpart Wednesday. The White House didn’t provide details, but a Russian spokesman said the topics included possible “top-level contact” soon between Putin and President Biden.Washington’s most emphatic warning about the Russian buildup was a Nov. 10 statement by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He cited “reports of unusual Russian military activity near Ukraine” and warned against “any escalatory or aggressive actions” by Russia. With Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba by his side, Blinken said America’s commitment to Ukraine’s territorial integrity was “ironclad,” but he avoided specifics about what the United States would do in the event of an invasion.CIA Director William J. Burns had paid a quiet visit to Moscow earlier this month. He told Russian officials about U.S. concern over the Russian troop buildup and warned that an invasion of Ukraine would bring severe economic reprisals. Administration officials were disappointed that Burns’s cautionary message didn’t seem to register with the Kremlin.To check Russia, the administration has tried to mobilize European allies, who are nearer to the firing line in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have both spoken directly with Putin over the past two weeks. Britain’s defense secretary met his Ukrainian counterpart in Kyiv. And Sweden’s defense minister said he was ready to send Swedish troops to Ukraine to help train that country’s military.The Biden administration has been making contingency plans with allies, in case Russia moves across the border. U.S. officials won’t discuss how they would respond, though they caution that, because Ukraine isn’t a NATO member, there’s no U.S. guarantee to protect Kyiv. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin expressed the uncertainty shared by U.S. allies when he admitted Wednesday: “We’re not sure exactly what Mr. Putin is up to.”The Kremlin seems increasingly determined to force Zelensky’s aggressively pro-western government into submission to Moscow. Putin this summer published a lengthy article explaining the historical roots of his view that, as he put it, Russians and Ukrainians represent “one people — a single whole.” He argued that “true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia.”Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and prime minister, followed Putin’s commentary with a blistering article in Kommersant, in October, titled “Why It Is Senseless to Deal with the Current Ukrainian Leadership.” He opened with a chilling bit of Ukrainian folk wisdom: “When the goat tangles with the wolf, only the skin will remain of the goat.”But Ukraine is a goat with teeth. An investigation released this week by the investigative group Bellingcat described an astonishingly bold sting operation by Zelensky’s intelligence operatives last year to capture dozens of Russian mercenaries who had fought in eastern Ukraine. Though it failed, that operation must have been galling for a former intelligence operative like Putin.The Biden administration is right to seek a more stable and predictable relationship with Russia.

He cautioned against believing the Russian military wouldn’t launch an offensive in the middle of the winter.The last time Russian-backed forces in east Ukraine took significant territory, changing the front lines of the conflict and capturing the city of Debaltseve, the offensive began in mid-January.The Biden administration dispatched CIA Director William J. Burns to Moscow earlier this month in part to warn the Russian government against pursuing any such renewed offensive, according to a U.S. official familiar with the visit. The U.S. government has also been sharing its intelligence with the Ukrainians and European allies to build a shared picture of the situation, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials.The information-sharing is a prelude to talks about what the United States, Canada and their European allies can do to warn the Kremlin against such an offensive and better prepare Ukraine for the possibility. Those actions could include issuing sanctions or providing more equipment to the Ukrainian military, one U.S. official said.Reznikov said U.S., European and Ukrainian officials must dissuade Putin from conducting a new offensive because any such invasion could be far more costly for Ukraine and Europe than Russia’s actions in 2014.“We need to stop him before, not after,” Reznikov said. “It will not be a Crimea case … it will be a bloody massacre.”Reznikov’s visit to the United States, his first as Ukraine’s newly minted defense minister, came as Putin gave an address to the Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow outlining his view of global affairs. Putin had harsh words for the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which he accused of leading to a “dead end” the Minsk accords designed to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east.Amid tensions with Russia, White House scrutinizes military exercises in EuropePutin also lashed out at exercises that the United States and its NATO allies have been conducting, often in conjunction with Ukraine, in the Black Sea region.

There have never been such plans,” Peskov said.Putin is testing U.S., NATO with buildup along Russia-Ukraine border, defense minister saysZelensky’s comments also come against a backdrop of rising tensions between Kyiv and Moscow.Western and Ukrainian officials say that they have observed a buildup of Russian forces on the country’s border with Ukraine.The reasons for the buildup are unclear, but U.S. and other officials say that it could be preparation for an invasion or an escalation in the seven-year-old conflict in eastern Ukraine with anti-Kyiv insurgents, backed by Moscow, according to Western officials and independent researchers.Speaking in Nantucket, Mass., President Biden told reporters that he would “in all probability” have talks with Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin over the deepening tensions.“I believe [Akhmetov] is being dragged into the war against Ukraine,” Zelensky said. “This will be a big mistake, because it is impossible to fight against the people, against the president elected by the people of Ukraine.”What you need to know about Ukraine and Russia tensionsZelensky said the alleged coup was being planned for Dec. 1 or 2. He gave no further details.Ukrainian media in recent weeks have commented on growing tensions between Zelensky and Akhmetov. Zelensky has launched a “de-oligarchization”campaign to reduce the political influence of Ukraine’s richest people, who control key sections of the economy.“I am outraged by the spread of this lie, no matter what the president’s motives are,” Akhmetov was quoted as saying. “My position has been and will be explicit and definite: an independent, democratic, and united Ukraine with the Crimea and my home region, Donbas.”Donbas is part of the breakaway region in eastern Ukraine. The Crimean Peninsula was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014.The Ukrainian president said his country was prepared for any scenario in the volatile east.“We are in full control of our borders and ready if there will be an escalation,” Zelensky said.He added, however, that the number of Russian forces was smaller than during a buildup in spring this year, an episode that also caused concern about a possible Russian offensive.Zelensky said Ukraine had received promises of support “in public and not in public” from its Western partners if Russia were to take military action, but he did not provide details.He said that the risk of escalation or invasion from Russia was always present and that Ukraine had observed a sharp rise in aggressive comments coming from Russia, which he said was worrying.“When Russia says it is defending its borders, it is very dangerous,” Zelensky said.

But they also hope to avoid provoking Moscow into further action as rhetoric grows more antagonistic on both sides.Blinken, speaking alongside Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics ahead of the NATO ministerial, said steps to intensify the Ukrainian conflict would be a serious concern for the United States, as they would to smaller nations on Russia’s periphery, such as Latvia.“Any renewed aggression would trigger serious consequences,” he said.Threat of Russian invasion of Ukraine tests Biden administrationBlinken has sought to reinforce U.S. support for Europe following the unsettling effects of President Donald Trump’s skepticism about the alliance.Asked by reporters whether the United States would stand up for allies, especially its less powerful ones, Blinken said the Biden administration was strongly committed to NATO’s mutual-defense pact and was working to invest in the alliance’s future.“But ultimately, what I would say to you and say to anyone else is don’t judge us by what we say, judge us by what we do,” he said. “That’s the ultimate test.”A possible renewed flash point over Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO, comes as the Biden administration hopes to shift its security focus from counterinsurgency to competition with China and Russia. On Monday, the Pentagon announced the conclusion of a months-long review of global troop placements, resulting in no major changes in Europe.Blinken’s remarks came as Putin, in a potential shift, described the expansion of NATO military infrastructure into Ukraine as a “red line” for Russia. Previously, Russian officials said they considered NATO membership for Ukraine the red line.Russian officials have taken a harder public line on Ukraine as U.S. and NATO officials raise alarms about the situation along the two countries’ border. Moscow has said the buildup is purely defensive.Also on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told journalists that “if the West fails to keep Ukraine in check but instead chooses to stimulate it, we will definitely take all necessary steps to ensure our security.”“Substantial forces and military hardware of NATO member states, including those American and British, are being deployed towards our border,” Lavrov added. “We simply have no right to rule out the chance of the Kyiv regime sliding into a reckless military venture.”Putin is testing U.S., NATO along Russia-Ukraine border, defense chief saysIt is not yet clear whether Blinken will meet with Lavrov when the two men attend an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe meeting in Sweden later this week.The crisis has further fanned tensions in Eastern Europe. On Monday, Belarus, a close Russia ally that for years took a neutral position on Ukraine, announced joint military drills with Russia on its southern border with Ukraine, accusing NATO of building up its offensive capabilities in the region.President Alexander Lukashenko, whose government is already targeted by Western sanctions, said that “it is clear whose side Belarus will be on,” referring to Moscow, if war breaks out between Russia and Ukraine.Also on the agenda for the NATO ministers is the migrant crisis along Belarus's border with Poland and the aftermath of the U.S. and NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan.Blinken, asked about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s allegations about a failed coup plot by Russians and Ukrainians, pointed to what he called Russia‘s “playbook” but stopped short of confirming such a plan.“Part of that playbook is to attempt to create and manufacture a so-called provocation as justification for something that Russia is planning to do all along,” he said. “Whether what’s been reported fits into that playbook, I don’t know.” Isabelle Khurshudyan in Moscow contributed to this report.",U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with foreign ministers from across the 30-member bloc.

KramerMASLOVKA, Russia — Deep in a pine forest in southern Russia, military trucks, their silhouettes blurred by camouflage netting, appear through the trees. Soldiers in four-wheel-drive vehicles creep along rutted dirt roads. And outside a newly pitched tent camp, sentries, Kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders, pace back and forth.Over the past month or so, Russia has deployed what analysts are calling the largest military buildup along the border with Ukraine since the outset of Kyiv’s war with Russian-backed separatists seven years ago.It is far from a clandestine operation: During a trip to southern Russia by a New York Times journalist, evidence of the buildup was everywhere to be seen.The mobilization is setting off alarms in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, European capitals and Washington, and is increasingly seen as an early foreign policy test for the Biden administration, which just hit Moscow with a new round of sanctions. Russia responded almost immediately, announcing on Friday that it would expel 10 U.S. diplomats.The American sanctions were intended to punish Russia for numerous past actions, including its meddling in United States elections, the “Solar Winds” hacking of government agencies and corporations, various disinformation efforts and the annexation of Crimea.Ukraine’s minister of defense, Andrii Taran, told European lawmakers on Wednesday that Russia is now garrisoning about 110,000 soldiers near the Ukrainian border. In Washington, the director of the C.I.A. told Congress that it remains unclear whether the buildup is a show of force or preparation for something more ominous.Even if the goal of the buildup remains unclear, military analysts say it was most certainly meant to be seen. A show of force is hardly a good show if nobody watches.“They are deploying in a very visible way,” said Michael Kofman, a senior researcher at CNA, a think tank based in Arlington, Va., who has been monitoring the military activity. “They are doing it overtly, so we can see it. It is intentional.”In fact, lest the movements go unnoticed, the Russian military has been issuing statements announcing some of them in advance. The high visibility has cost Russia any element of surprise, leading analysts to minimize but not rule out the possibility of an actual attack.More likely, they say, the buildup is intended as a warning to the West not to take Russia for granted. After four years of deference from the Trump administration, President Vladimir V. Putin now finds himself in an uncomfortably exposed position, Dmitri Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow Center said in a recent essay.The Kremlin’s relations with Europe are at their lowest ebb since the Gorbachev era, soured over evidence of Russian intrigue and meddling. “At the same time,” Mr. Trenin wrote, “coordination between U.S. and European policies on Russia has substantially increased under Biden.”Notoriously sensitive to any slights, Mr. Putin cannot help but recognize that Russia is still well down the list of President Biden’s foreign policy priorities. Domestic political calculations could play a role, too, as a bit of saber rattling might help prop up the Russian leader’s sagging popularity ratings.Mr. Putin might also have been provoked by the actions of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who in recent months has moved troops close to the border with the separatist regions, shut down Russia-friendly TV stations and charged some separatist leaders with treason.From this perspective, the massed troops could also serve to pressure Ukraine to shift its positions in talks to settle the war more on Russia’s terms.Up close, the Russian buildup is even harder to miss. Tank tracks cut across a parking lot inside the village. Children on the roadsides gawk as six-wheeled military trucks roll by, kicking up clouds of dust. Russian and foreign reporters have been showing up daily to watch the buzz of activity.Interviewed on a recent, balmy spring day as they turned over the damp black soil of their garden plots for planting, residents of villages near the Pogonovo training ground, an epicenter of this buildup, seemed happy to play along with the supposed cloak of secrecy.Yevdokia Novikova, 86, a retired nurse, said the military activity all about was conveying a message to the West: “It is pointless to fight with Russia,” she said of the message.But then, her eyes narrowing with suspicion of a foreigner asking questions about the military vehicles seen all about, she also said the activity was not meant to be seen at all. “Watch out!” she said. “If you write the wrong words you could get hit with a stick.”But this otherwise unremarkable rural region on the Russian steppe, about 110 miles from th",Russia's massing of tanks and infantry along its southwestern border with Ukraine was meant to send a message.

But as Russia’s military buildup proceeds, the tension is rising in war-weary Eastern Ukraine.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Anton TroianovskiMARIUPOL, Ukraine — There are the booms that echo again, and parents know to tell their children they are only fireworks. There are the drones the separatists started flying behind the lines at night, dropping land mines. There are the fresh trenches the Ukrainians can see their enemy digging, the increase in sniper fire pinning them inside their own.But perhaps the starkest evidence that the seven-year-old war in Ukraine may be entering a new phase is what Capt. Mykola Levytskyi’s coast guard unit saw cruising in the Azov Sea just outside the port city of Mariupol last week: a flotilla of Russian amphibious assault ships.Since the start of the war in 2014, Russia has used the pretext of a separatist conflict to pressure Ukraine after its Westward-looking revolution, supplying arms and men to Kremlin-backed rebels in the country’s east while denying that it was a party to the fight.Few Western analysts believe the Kremlin is planning an invasion of eastern Ukraine, given the likely backlash at home and abroad. But with a large-scale Russian troop buildup on land and sea on Ukraine’s doorstep, the view is spreading among officials and wide swathes of the Ukrainian public that Moscow is signaling more bluntly than ever before that it is prepared to openly enter the conflict.“These ships are, concretely, a threat from the Russian state,” Captain Levytskyi said over the whir of his speedboat’s engines as it plied the Azov Sea, after pointing out a Russian patrol boat stationed six miles offshore. “It is a much more serious threat.”Many Ukrainian military officials and volunteer fighters say that they still find it unlikely that Russia will openly invade Ukraine, and that they do not see evidence of an imminent offensive among the gathered Russian forces. But they speculate over other possibilities, including Russia’s possible recognition or annexation of the separatist-held territories in eastern Ukraine.Ukrainians are awaiting President Vladimir V. Putin’s annual state-of-the-nation address to Russia on Wednesday, an affair often rife with geopolitical signaling, for clues about what comes next.“I feel confused, I feel tension,” Oleksandr Tkachenko, Ukraine’s culture and information policy minister, said in an interview.Mr. Tkachenko listed some invasion scenarios: a three-pronged Russian attack from north, south and east; an assault from separatist-held territory; and an attempt to capture a Dnieper River water supply for Crimea.Russia, for its part, has done little to hide its buildup, insisting that it has been massing troops in response to heightened military activity in the region by NATO and Ukraine.Ukrainian officials deny any plans to escalate the war, but there is no question that President Volodymyr Zelensky has taken a harder line against Russia in recent months.Mr. Zelensky has closed pro-Russian television channels and imposed sanctions against Mr. Putin’s closest ally in Ukraine. He has also declared more openly than before his desire to have Ukraine join NATO, a remote possibility that the Kremlin nevertheless regards as a dire threat to Russia’s security.Interviews with frontline units across a 150-mile swath of eastern Ukraine in recent days underscored the fast-rising tensions in Europe’s only active armed conflict. Officials and volunteers acknowledge apprehension over Russia’s troop movements, and civilians feel numb and hopeless after seven years of war. At least 28 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in fighting this year, the military says.“We live in sadness,” said Anna Dikareva, a 48-year-old postal service worker in the frontline industrial town of Avdiivka, where people scarcely flinch when shells explode in the distance. “I don’t want war, but we won’t solve this in a peaceful way, either.”For much of last year, a cease-fire held.Mr. Zelensky, a television comedian elected in 2019 on a promise to end the war, negotiated with the Kremlin for step-by-step compromises to ease the hardships of frontline residents and look for ways out of a conflict that has killed more than 13,000 people. But Russia’s insistence on policies that would essentially give it a say in eastern Ukraine’s future was unacceptable to Kyiv.“The hope that Zelensky had to solve this issue, it didn’t happen,” said Mr. Tkachenko, the information minister and a longtime associate of the president.Instead, the fighting has picked up again.The Ukrainians’ labyrinths of trenches and fortifications along the roughly 250-mile front is by now so well established that in one tunnel near Avdiivka, the soldiers put up multicolored Christmas lights to spruce up the darkness. The town lies just a few miles north of the city of Donetsk, the separatists’","Few analysts believe Moscow intends to invade Ukraine.

Putin, amid growing tensions abroad, said Russia’s response would be “asymmetric, fast and tough” if forced to defend its interests.This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of President Vladimir Putin’s speech, and the reaction, here.Putin says nations that threaten Russia’s security will ‘regret their deeds.’Ukraine’s president warns that war may be coming, and vows that his nation will stand ‘to the last man.’Navalny says he’s ‘a skeleton walking’ as worries grow about his medical condition in prison.Thousands protest near the Kremlin as the police seek to disperse crowds.In pictures: Protesters gather in Moscow.Friction between the U.S. and Russia deepens.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Wednesday delivered an annual address replete with threats against the West but, despite intense tensions with Ukraine, stopped short of announcing new military or foreign policy moves.Russia’s response will be “asymmetric, fast and tough” if it is forced to defend its interests, Mr. Putin said, pointing to what he claimed were Western efforts at regime change in neighboring Belarus as another threat to Russia’s security.He pledged that Russia “wants to have good relations with all participants of international society,” even as he noted that Russia’s modernized nuclear weapons systems were at the ready.“The organizers of any provocations threatening the fundamental interests of our security will regret their deeds more than they have regretted anything in a long time,” Mr. Putin told a hall of governors and members of Parliament. “I hope no one gets the idea to cross the so-called red line with Russia — and we will be the ones to decide where it runs in every concrete case.”Mr. Putin’s speech had been widely anticipated, with about 100,000 Russian troops massed on Ukraine’s border and Ukraine’s president warning openly of the possibility of war. Some analysts had speculated that Mr. Putin might use his annual state of the nation address to announce a pretext for sending troops into Ukraine.But that possible outcome did not come to pass, even as Russia’s enormous military presence near Ukraine’s borders showed no sign of receding. Mr. Putin also made no reference to the jailed opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, whose supporters were holding protests across the country on Wednesday.Instead, Mr. Putin spent most of his speech on domestic issues, acknowledging Russians’ discontent with the hardships of the pandemic. He outlined programs to subsidize summer camp for children, smooth the system for child-support payments to single mothers and move more social services online.Still, it was too early to tell whether Mr. Putin, 68, was pulling back from the brink. Now in his third decade in power, he appears more convinced than ever of his special, historic role as the father of a reborn Russian nation, fighting at home and abroad against a craven, hypocritical, morally decaying West.“This sense of superiority mixed with arrogance gives him a feeling of power, and this is dangerous,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian analyst who has studied Mr. Putin for years. “When you think you are more powerful and more wise than everyone else around you, you think you have a certain historical mandate for more wide-ranging action.”Mr. Putin has made moves in recent weeks that, even by his standards, signal an escalation in his conflict with those he perceives as enemies, foreign and domestic. Russian prosecutors last week filed suit to outlaw Mr. Navalny’s organization, a step that could result in the most intense wave of political repression in post-Soviet Russia. And in Russia’s southwest, Mr. Putin has built up a military force, the Kremlin has indicated, that could be prepared to move into neighboring Ukraine.In Washington, the Biden administration reacted mildly to Mr. Putin’s tough words.“We don’t take anything President Putin says personally,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said when asked for a response. “We have tough skin.”Asked if the sharpened rhetoric from Mr. Putin would affect the prospects for a possible meeting with President Biden later this year, Ms. Psaki said discussions were ongoing. “Obviously,” she said, “it requires all parties having an agreement that we’re going to have a meeting and we issued that invitation.”— Andrew E.

Kramer and Anton TroianovskiMOSCOW — Russia’s Defense Ministry ordered a partial pullback of troops from the border with Ukraine on Thursday, signaling a possible de-escalation in a military standoff that had raised alarm that a new war in Europe could be looming.The order came a day after President Vladimir V. Putin, in an annual state of the nation address, rattled off a list of grievances against Western nations, including threats of new sanctions. Mr. Putin warned against crossing a Russian “red line” with additional pressure on Moscow. The huge buildup on the Ukrainian border was in place while he spoke.That mobilization had increasingly worried the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, European capitals and Washington, and was seen as an early foreign policy challenge for the Biden administration.The Russian defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, who had called the buildup a test of the Russian military’s readiness, said the units deployed to the border area had shown their capabilities and should now return to their regular positions.“I think the goals of the readiness test are achieved fully,” Mr. Shoigu said, according to the official Russian news agency Tass, which reported that he had ordered troops to return to their barracks by May 1.However, the order specified that troops departing from one large field camp about 100 miles from the border with the eastern Ukrainian region known as Donbas should leave their armored vehicles there until the fall. Satellite images had shown hundreds of trucks and tanks parked in fields in the area.A Russian ban on civilian air traffic near the Ukrainian border until Saturday also remained in effect on Thursday.Soon after Mr. Shoigu’s announcement, Ukraine’s president — who only two days earlier addressed his nation on television, warning of the possibility of war — said he welcomed Russia’s move.“The reduction of troops on our border proportionally reduces tension,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Twitter.Ukraine, he added, “is always vigilant, yet welcomes any steps to decrease the military presence” and “de-escalate the situation in Donbas. Ukraine seeks peace.”Ukraine, a vast country in Eastern Europe that was once part of the Soviet Union, has been a flash point of East-West tensions for many years. Efforts by Ukraine’s government to align itself with the West have deeply angered the Kremlin, which sees Ukraine as part of Russia’s sphere of influence in the region.The tensions have been elevated since 2014, when Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The conflict between Ukrainian forces and separatists has killed more than 13,000 people, and increased violations of a cease-fire there that preceded the Russian military buildup.In Ukraine, many had feared that the buildup — which officials in Kyiv said included some 110,000 Russian troops — could be the prelude to a Russian annexation of separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine or an outright invasion.For the moment, at least, the withdrawal announcement signaled that such a move was not imminent. But Ukrainian officials said they continued to be prepared for an escalation of the conflict.“Their position on Ukraine is not changing,” Mr. Zelensky’s national security adviser, Oleksiy Danilov, said in an interview on Thursday, referring to Russia. “They want to bring back the empire, in those borders that existed in the previous century.”Throughout the buildup, Russian officials never formally stated specific demands, even as tanks accumulated on the border. Analysts suggested they sought concessions in settlement talks with Ukraine or hoped to dissuade the Biden administration from imposing sanctions.A brewing conflict. Antagonism between Ukraine and Russia has been simmering since 2014, when the Russian military crossed into Ukrainian territory, annexing Crimea and whipping up a rebellion in the east. A tenuous cease-fire was reached in 2015, but peace has been elusive.A spike in hostilities. Russia has recently been building up forces near its border with Ukraine, and the Kremlin’s rhetoric toward its neighbor has hardened. Concern grew in late October, when Ukraine used an armed drone to attack a howitzer operated by Russian-backed separatists.Ominous warnings. Russia called the strike a destabilizing act that violated the cease-fire agreement, raising fears of a new intervention in Ukraine that could draw the United States and Europe into a new phase of the conflict.The Kremlin’s position.

Putin of Russia on Wednesday delivered an annual address replete with threats against the West but, despite intense tensions with Ukraine, stopped short of announcing new military or foreign policy moves. Russia’s response will be “asymmetric, fast and tough” if it is forced to defend its interests, Mr. Putin said, pointing to what he claimed were Western efforts at regime change in neighboring Belarus as another threat to Russia’s security. He pledged that Russia “wants to have good relations with all participants of international society,” even as he noted that Russia’s modernized nuclear weapons systems were at the ready. “The organizers of any provocations threatening the fundamental interests of our security will regret their deeds more than they have regretted anything in a long time,” Mr. Putin told a hall of governors and members of Parliament. “I hope no one gets the idea to cross the so-called red line with Russia — and we will be the ones to decide where it runs in every concrete case.” Mr. Putin’s speech had been widely anticipated, with about 100,000 Russian troops massed on Ukraine’s border and Ukraine’s president warning openly of the possibility of war. Some analysts had speculated that Mr. Putin might use his annual state of the nation address to announce a pretext for sending troops into Ukraine. But that possible outcome did not come to pass, even as Russia’s enormous military presence near Ukraine’s borders showed no sign of receding. Mr. Putin also made no reference to the jailed opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, whose supporters were holding protests across the country on Wednesday. Instead, Mr. Putin spent most of his speech on domestic issues, acknowledging Russians’ discontent with the hardships of the pandemic. He outlined programs to subsidize summer camp for children, smooth the system for child-support payments to single mothers and move more social services online. Still, it was too early to tell whether Mr. Putin, 68, was pulling back from the brink. Now in his third decade in power, he appears more convinced than ever of his special, historic role as the father of a reborn Russian nation, fighting at home and abroad against a craven, hypocritical, morally decaying West. “This sense of superiority mixed with arrogance gives him a feeling of power, and this is dangerous,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian analyst who has studied Mr. Putin for years. “When you think you are more powerful and more wise than everyone else around you, you think you have a certain historical mandate for more wide-ranging action.” Mr. Putin has made moves in recent weeks that, even by his standards, signal an escalation in his conflict with those he perceives as enemies, foreign and domestic. Russian prosecutors last week filed suit to outlaw Mr. Navalny’s organization, a step that could result in the most intense wave of political repression in post-Soviet Russia. And in Russia’s southwest, Mr. Putin has built up a military force, the Kremlin has indicated, that could be prepared to move into neighboring Ukraine. In Washington, the Biden administration reacted mildly to Mr. Putin’s tough words. “We don’t take anything President Putin says personally,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said when asked for a response. “We have tough skin.” Asked if the sharpened rhetoric from Mr. Putin would affect the prospects for a possible meeting with President Biden later this year, Ms. Psaki said discussions were ongoing. “Obviously,” she said, “it requires all parties having an agreement that we’re going to have a meeting and we issued that invitation.”",Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers his annual state of the nation address.

Blinken, noted that, despite a partial pullback by Moscow, “significant” military forces remained on the border. He also urged the Ukrainian president to tackle internal graft.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Michael CrowleyKYIV, Ukraine — Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told Ukraine’s president on Thursday that the United States strongly backed his country’s sovereignty against Russia’s military aggression but also warned that the embattled country was under threat from “internal forces,” including powerful oligarchs who thrive on corruption.Mr. Blinken also said that, despite Russia’s recently announced plans to withdraw many of the 100,000 troops it had built up along the border with Ukraine in an alarming show of force this spring, a clear military threat remained.“Russia has pulled back some forces, but significant forces remain on Ukraine’s border,” Mr. Blinken noted. “And so Russia has the capacity on fairly short notice to take aggressive actions if it so chooses.” Mr. Blinken added that the United States was “watching this very, very carefully.”Mr. Blinken spoke at a joint news conference with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who effusively thanked the first senior Biden official to visit Kyiv since the departure of President Donald J. Trump from office. The former president ensnared Mr. Zelensky in a global scandal that the Ukrainian leader clearly hopes to forget.Asked whether efforts in 2019 by Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, had “set back” efforts to drive corruption out of Ukraine’s political system, Mr. Zelensky boasted about his reform record, then indicated that he hopes the matter is finished.“Let’s not talk about the past,” he said. “Let’s let bygones be bygones, and let’s discuss the future.”That may be difficult, given an active F.B.I. investigation into Mr. Giuliani that culminated last week in a raid on his apartment and office. Federal agents were reportedly seeking evidence of his role in the May 2019 removal of the American ambassador to Ukraine, allegedly at the behest of Mr. Giuliani’s Ukrainian associates.Mr. Blinken for his part maneuvered around a question featuring Mr. Giuliani, but reminded Mr. Zelensky — whose reform record has drawn mixed reviews — that “effectively combating corruption is one of the most important issues to the Ukrainian people, and is crucial to improving their lives.”“There are powerful interests lined up against reform, against anticorruption efforts,” Mr. Blinken said. “Those include external forces, like Russia, but also internal forces, like oligarchs and other powerful individuals who are pursuing their own narrow interests.”Even as Ukraine struggles to flush corruption from its political system, partly fueled by a Kremlin seeking to destabilize its pro-Washington government, the country is fending off a Moscow-backed, pro-Russian separatist insurgency in the country’s east. Fighting in the region has claimed more than 13,000 lives, according to the United Nations.To sustain that conflict, and to weather any new offensive by Russia, Ukrainian officials are eager for more military assistance and potential arms sales from Washington, which currently sends Ukraine more than $400 million in annual military aid. Mr. Blinken said that the Biden administration was “working very actively” on the subject but offered no further details.But Mr. Blinken underscored his concern about Ukraine’s military plight with a morning visit to an outdoor memorial for soldiers who have died in the conflict in the east. The monument, known as the Wall of National Remembrance, features hundreds of photographs of the fallen that run along an outer wall of St. Michael’s, a 12th-century monastery and church.In driving rain, Mr. Blinken, accompanied by the senior figure in Ukraine’s Orthodox Church and the country’s foreign minister, knelt to lay flowers at the foot of the wall.Later, Mr. Blinken told Mr. Zelensky that the pictures of the fallen had touched him personally.“We were able to pay tribute to those who lost their lives defending Ukraine’s democracy,” he said. “And it’s very, very moving to be at the wall.”“You see in those pictures, each one of them — and you think of the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the children who have lost their loved ones because they were defending Ukraine, and it’s very, very powerful,” he added.In September 2019, a C.I.A. whistle blower revealed that Mr. Trump, in a June 2019 phone call with Mr. Zelensky, pressured him to announce an investigation into Mr. Biden, then a Democratic contender for president, and Mr. Biden’s son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company. Mr. Trump withheld U.S. military aid to Ukraine as he pressed his request. The episode led to Mr. Trump’s first impeachment and a painfully awkward experience for Mr. Zelensky.A brewing conflict.

NYT,Ukraine-Russia,7,"Germany suspended its approval of Nord Stream 2, an undersea gas pipeline from Russia. It comes amid a jump in energy prices in Europe and tensions between Moscow and Europe over Belarus and Ukraine.",https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/business/germany-gas-pipeline.html,"The approval process to certify Nord Stream 2, an undersea gas pipeline running from Russia to Germany that has sparked concerns about Russian influence in Europe, ground to a halt on Tuesday when a German regulator said the owners of the pipeline had failed to file the necessary paperwork.The action means that the recently completed pipeline will not begin supplying gas to Germany anytime soon, and it comes against the backdrop of a politically charged jump in energy prices in Europe and rising tensions between Moscow and Europe over a refugee crisis in Belarus and Russian troops gathering near Ukraine.The news caused a jump in European natural gas markets, with the price of U.K. natural gas futures soaring more than 17 percent on Tuesday, amid concerns that Europe will run short of gas this winter.It also comes as Germany finds itself in political limbo, with Chancellor Angela Merkel, a firm supporter of the pipeline project, reduced to a caretaker role while leaders from the Social Democratic, Green and Free Democratic parties debate the makeup of a new government, one that has the potential to be less favorable to its predecessor’s pet energy project.The problem stemmed from the pipeline’s foreign ownership. Nord Stream 2 AG is based in Switzerland and is wholly owned by Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas company. In order to manage the German portion of the operation, Nord Stream 2 needed to set up a subsidiary in the country.The German regulator, the Federal Network Agency, which oversees essential infrastructure, said that Nord Stream 2 AG had failed to file the proper paperwork to establish the subsidiary. Once the subsidiary has met the necessary bureaucratic requirements, an evaluation can begin anew.A German subsidiary is necessary “to ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations” Jens D. Mueller, a spokesman for Nord Stream 2 AG, said in an email. He declined to comment on the impact the suspension would have on the ability to get the pipeline up and running. The agency had previously set a Jan. 10 deadline for the completion of its approval process. But it does not have the final say in the project, which also requires approval from the European Commission that can be taken up only once the German agency has signed off — meaning Europe could be well into spring before any gas flows.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has pushed for the German regulators to approve the pipeline as a way of easing Europe’s natural gas crisis, telling an energy conference in October that Moscow would “expand supplies” along the 750-mile pipeline once it received regulatory approval. Many in Europe suspect that Mr. Putin has deliberately held back natural gas to create pressure to approve the new pipeline.But when Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, threatened to cut off Russian natural gas that flows through his country to Europe — a retaliation for recent European Union sanctions over fraud in claiming a sweeping re-election victory in August and for harsh suppression of dissent — Mr. Putin chastised him, telling Europeans that he had spoken in anger.The post-Merkel era begins. For the first time in 16 years, Germany has a center-left government and a new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, whose job will be to fill the shoes of Angela Merkel. Here’s what to know about the new government:Who is Olaf Scholz? A lifelong Social Democrat, Mr. Scholz, 63, has been a familiar face in German politics and served in two governments led by Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Party, most recently as her finance minister. But he has also been something of a political chameleon.An uncommon coalition. The new government led by Mr. Scholz brings together three parties — the Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats. It is the first time since the 1950s that three partners have formed a government.The governing deal. Despite their differences, the parties said they had found enough common ground to push forward with plans to beat back the pandemic, increase the minimum wage, address climate change and legalize marijuana.The pandemic offers a crucial test. A spike in cases has thrust Germany into its worst crisis of the pandemic, vaulting the issue to the top of the coalition’s agenda. But in its first test, the incoming government sent mixed signals before the latest wave forced a retreat to tougher measures.Foreign policy crises await. Rarely has a German leader come into office with so many burning crises. Mr. Scholz will have to deal with tensions on the Polish-Belarusian border, a Russian president mobilizing troops near Ukraine, a more confrontational China and a less dependable U.S.The United States opposed Nord Stream 2 for years, but in July, the Biden administration waived a threat to impose sanctions to block the project after concluding that the pipeline could not be stopped without a counterproductive fight with Germany.Poland and other Eastern European countries have al",German regulator says Nord Stream 2 will not begin supplying gas to Germany anytime soon.

Russian-backed separatists have been fighting the Ukrainian government in the region since 2014.The Ukrainian president’s spokeswoman said this month that Russia had more than 40,000 troops deployed on Ukraine’s eastern border and over 40,000 in Crimea. Around 50,000 of them were new deployments, she said. Moscow has not provided any troop numbers. In a tweet, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine ""welcomes any steps to decrease the military presence & deescalate the situation in Donbas (eastern Ukraine)"", adding ""Grateful to international partners for their support"".Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had told Reuters Kyiv did not know whether Moscow intended to launch an attack or not, and said the West must make clear it would stand with Ukraine if Russia did so.""So it can go in either direction now,"" Kuleba said. ""And this is why the reaction of the West, the consolidated reaction of the West, is so important now, to prevent Putin ... from making that decision.""U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Washington was aware of Russia's announcement and was watching the situation on the border closely. ""We've heard words. I think what we'll be looking for is action,"" Price said.Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said he had ordered troops involved in exercises to return to their bases by May 1, as they had completed what he called an ""inspection"" in the border area.""I believe the objectives of the snap inspection have been fully achieved. The troops have demonstrated their ability to provide a credible defence for the country,"" Shoigu said.Service members of the Russian airborne forces line up before boarding Ilyushin Il-76 transport planes during drills at a military aerodrome in the Azov Sea port of Taganrog, Russia April 22, 2021. Picture taken with a drone. REUTERS/Stringer EQUIPMENT LEFTMilitary hardware was to be left at a training ground near the city of Voronezh, about six hours' drive from Ukraine, so that it could be used again later this year in another big scheduled exercise.Hours earlier, Shoigu had attended manoeuvres in Crimea, which Moscow said involved 10,000 troops and more than 40 warships. Russia also announced it had arrested a Ukrainian man in Crimea as a spy.The troop buildup near Ukraine was one of several issues that have raised tensions between Russia and the West.Last week, the United States tightened sanctions on Russia over accusations that it had hacked computers and meddled in U.S. elections, and the Czech Republic accused Moscow of a role in deadly explosions at an arms dump in 2014.Both countries expelled Russian diplomats, prompting angry denials and tit-for-tat expulsions by Moscow.Western countries have also urged Russia to free jailed hunger-striking opposition figure Alexei Navalny, with Washington warning of ""consequences"" should he die in prison. Russia says the West should not interfere.In a major speech on Wednesday, President Vladimir Putin sounded a defiant note, warning Western countries not to cross unspecified ""red lines"". But Putin is also participating this week in a climate summit organised by U.S. President Joe Biden.In Moscow, the Kremlin said Putin was aware of an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to meet to discuss the crisis.“If the president considers it necessary, he will reply himself. I have nothing to say on that now,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.",Russia announces withdrawal of troops from area near border with Ukraine.

And what we see is a significant, large Russian military build-up,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference with Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Brussels.He said he did not want to speculate about Russia's intentions but added: ""We see an unusual concentration of troops, and we know that Russia has been willing to use these types of military capabilities before to conduct aggressive actions against Ukraine.""The Russian troop movements have over the past days spurred fears of a possible attack. Moscow has dismissed such suggestions as inflammatory and complained about increasing activity in the region by the NATO transatlantic alliance.Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and says the waters around it belong to Moscow now, despite most countries continuing to recognise the peninsula as Ukrainian.Russian-backed separatists took control of Ukraine's eastern Donbass region that same year and soldiers on both sides continue to be regularly killed in the conflict there.The troop border build-up - which Ukraine last week estimated at 100,000 - was dangerous, said Stoltenberg, because it reduced the amount of warning time, should Russia decide to ""conduct a military aggressive action against Ukraine.""""This is partly forces close to the border between Russia and Ukraine, but it is also partly troops and capabilities which are inside Ukraine, meaning they are in Crimea, which is illegally annexed, and also we see the militants, the separatists in Donbass, which is also part of Ukraine, supported and helped by Russia,"" he said.A NATO source, asked to describe how Russia is going about deploying its military equipment towards Ukraine, said: ""large equipment such as tanks, self-propelled artillery and infantry fighting vehicles is moved at night to avoid tell-tale pictures showing up on social media as they did during the Russian military build-up in spring.""""It can go either way,"" Lithuania's foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters, also on Monday, on the margins of a meeting with his European Union counterparts.

Zelenskiy himself gave few details and stopped short of saying whether he believed the Kremlin was behind the plot.But the accusation raised the temperature at a time when Kyiv and its Western allies have already accused Moscow of massing troops near the Ukrainian border for a possible assault, a suggestion Moscow dismisses as false and alarmist.Speaking at an hours-long news conference, Zelenskiy said Ukrainian intelligence had obtained audio recordings of the plotters talking about involving business magnate Rinat Akhmetov into joining their coup.""We have challenges not only from the Russian Federation and possible escalation - we have big internal challenges. I received information that a coup d'etat will take place in our country on Dec. 1-2,"" Zelenskiy said.Akhmetov said in a statement: ""The information made public by Volodymyr Zelenskiy about attempts to draw me into some kind of coup is an absolute lie.

REUTERS/Johanna?GeronBRUSSELS, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmygal accused Russia on Tuesday of being ""absolutely"" behind what he called an attempt to organise a coup to overthrow the pro-Western government in Kyiv, citing intelligence.Last Friday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine had uncovered a plot to topple his government this week, involving individuals from Russia, but he stopped short of saying whether he believed the Kremlin was behind the plot.The Kremlin has denied any role in any coup plot and rejected as baseless other accusations that it has sought to destabilise Ukraine, a fellow former Soviet republic.""We have secret data which demonstrates the special intentions (to foment a coup),"" Shmygal said. Asked if the Russian state was behind it, he said: ""Absolutely.""He also said a Russian military build-up on Ukraine's border, the second such surge since May, was part of a wider Russian effort to break Ukrainian momentum towards joining the European Union.""They are preparing something,"" Shmygal said of Russia, without elaborating.Shmygal, who is in Brussels for talks with top EU officials, said Ukrainian intelligence had picked up activities of ""outside powers"" trying to influence political opposition within the country to stoke a popular uprising and coup.Zelenskiy, a former actor who once played a fictional president in a popular sitcom, came to power with a landslide election victory in 2019 though his popularity has fallen after 2-1/2 years in power.But Shmygal said: ""In Ukrainian society, there is no revolutionary mood. We understand there was influence from outside to enforce protests in Kyiv, to make them stronger. Our secret service is making a special investigation.""Shmygal also said the sacking this week of Oleksandr Rusnak, the head of the counterintelligence department of Ukraine Security Service (SBU), was unrelated.He said Ukraine's aspiration to join the EU was among the main reasons for what he said was Russian aggression, hybrid attacks, a military build-up on its border and Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea. Ukraine has also been fighting a pro-Russian insurgency in the country's east since 2014.Ukrainians ousted a Russian-backed president in February 2014 in a pro-European uprising. Along with Moldova and Georgia, it hopes for the promise of closer ties with the EU at a special ""Eastern Partnership"" summit next month.EU and other Western leaders are involved in a geopolitical tug-of-war with Russia for influence in Ukraine and two other ex-Soviet republics, Moldova and Georgia, through trade, cooperation and protection arrangements. Ukraine is also seeking more military support from the United States, Shmygal said.""This is one of the main reasons for the hybrid attacks from the Russian side, because we strongly would like to be integrated into Europe, to have the standard of living of European, of civilised countries,"" he said.""That is why we have all these hybrid attacks, cyber attacks, physical military attacks, occupied territories, disinformation to hamper Ukraine's European aspirations.""","Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmygal says Russia is ""absolutely"" behind coup.

But I hope it doesn't come to that.

The US is required to give 14 days notice of its intention to enter the Black Sea under a 1936 treaty giving Turkey control of the straits to enter the sea. It is unclear if a notice has yet been sent.The Defense official also said the Navy is continuing to fly reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace over the Black Sea to monitor Russian naval activity and any troops movements in Crimea. On Wednesday, two US B-1 bombers conducted missions over the Aegean Sea.Although the US does not see the amassing of Russian forces as posturing for an offensive action, the official told CNN that ""if something changes we will be ready to respond."" Their current assessment is that the Russians are conducting training and exercises and intelligence has not indicated military orders for further action, the official said, but noted that they are well-aware that could change at any time.The Biden administration and the international community have expressed concerns about mounting tensions between Ukraine and Russia. In recent weeks, President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Tony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley and national security adviser Jake Sullivan have all spoken to their Ukrainian counterparts.On Thursday White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Russia's actions are ""deeply concerning.""""The United States is increasingly concerned by recently escalating Russian aggressions in eastern Ukraine, including Russia's movements on Ukraine's border. Russia now has more troops on the border of Ukraine than any time since 2014. Five Ukrainian soldiers have been killed this week alone. These are all deeply concerning signs,"" Psaki said.She also said a review of the Russian government's actions will be concluded in ""weeks, not months,"" and that new sanctions on Moscow would not be introduced this week.The Pentagon and State Department have also expressed their concern about Russia's behavior in eastern Ukraine.""We are concerned by recent escalating Russian aggressions in eastern Ukraine, including the credible reports that have been emanating about Russian troop movements on Ukraine's borders and occupied Crimea,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said this week. ""We have asked Russia for an explanation of these provocations, but most importantly what we have signaled directly with our Ukrainian partners is a message of reassurance,"" he said.Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said this week that it was important ""for all sides to comply with the Minsk Agreement"" and ""for the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of Ukraine to be respected by Russia.""On Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to withdraw troops in order to de-escalate the situation, according to a spokesperson for the German government.According to a Kremlin readout of the call, Putin accused Kyiv of ""provocative actions.""",The United States is considering sending warships into the Black Sea.

CNN,Ukraine-Russia,2,Ukraine's President heads to the trenches as Russia masses its troops,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/12/europe/ukraine-zelensky-front-lines/index.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twCNN&utm_content=2021-04-12T11:58:26,"Ankle-deep in thick black sludge, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky moves stealthily with his troops in single file through the warren of trenches and tunnels that form the tense front lines in the east of his country.  CNN's Zahra Ullah and Jasmine Wright contributed to this story.It feels more like the early 20th century than a modern conflict, with tired, nervous soldiers gripping their rifles around him as they reach open ground, scanning the area for movement across no-mans-land.  They know snipers, likely trained by Russians, say Ukrainian officials are looking for a chance to fire. More than 20 of their comrades have been gunned down already this year.  It's eerily quiet with an occasional crack of a gunshot in the distance shattering the calm, keeping everybody on edge.   This area near Mariupol is a risky place for the President of a country to visit, but that doesn't stop Zelensky who granted CNN unprecedented access to his trip to the front lines, where he insists on going to the most forward positions.  ""If I visit a military base, the guys at the very front will hear about it and think I forgot about them,"" Zelensky told CNN in exclusive comments over two days. ""They need to know they have political support."" Zelensky, strapped into a camouflage flak jacket and helmet, has to sprint across the open ground with his presidential security to reach the trench cover.  With Russian troops massing on their side of the border with Ukraine, the US and its NATO allies declared political and military backing for Ukraine. Zelensky urged them to bolster their support.      New boiling point in long standoff  For years, the brutal conflict in eastern Ukraine, between government forces and Russian-backed separatists, has been locked in a tense standoff. Major combat, which cost thousands of lives since 2014, has given way to a grinding stalemate. Following the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, fighting erupted in the neighboring Donbas region -- another mainly Russian speaking area of Ukraine with rebels demanding independence from Kiev.  But amid growing tensions with the United States and its Western allies, Russian forces have again been spotted on the move across the border sparking concerns the war may be reignited. Cell phone video has emerged of Russian armored columns driving towards the Ukrainian frontier. Tanks and artillery guns have been seen being transported by rail. There's also been a build-up reported in Crimea.  In Moscow, the Kremlin says the troop movements are inside Russia, part of a planned military exercise and pose no threat.But at the front lines, the Ukrainian President told CNN a Russian invasion is a very real possibility his country is bracing for.  ""Of course. We know it, from 2014 we know it can be each day,"" he said.   ""They are ready, but we are also ready because we are on our land and our territory,"" he told CNN.   Lt. Gen. Ruslan Khomchak, commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, told CNN an estimated 50,000 Russian troops have now gathered across the Russian border and in Crimea. In addition, there are at least 35,000 Russian-backed separatists in rebel-held areas of Ukraine, he said.  Even before this current worrying build up in the number of troops at Moscow's command on Ukraine's doorstep, Zelensky called for the US to sell it weapons, such as Javelin anti-tank missiles. Those weapons have now been delivered, most notoriously in a phone conversation with then-President Donald Trump.    US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that there are ""real concerns"" over Russia's action. On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Blinken said, ""The question is, 'Is Russia going to continue to act aggressively and recklessly?' If it does, the [US] President's been clear, there'll be costs, there'll be consequences.""   CNN reported Friday that the US is considering sending warships into the Black Sea in the next few weeks in a show of support for Ukraine.  Lurching to the future  From the air, above the muddy trenches, the seemingly endless flatness of eastern Ukraine is punctuated by battered towns and the rusting industrial hulks of the Soviet-era factories that made this war-ravaged region Ukraine's economic backbone.   Military helicopters, deafening old MI-8s first developed during the Soviet era, painted in unnaturally vivid combat camouflage, fly fast and low over the countryside to avoid ground fire. Every few minutes they lurch upwards to leapfrog trees or electricity lines, then quickly plunge back down again within feet of the soil.   On board the aging presidential chopper, which retains a degree of well-worn comfort, Zelensky shouts above the engine noise of how the US is a ""good friend"" of Ukraine, but that President Biden ""must do more,"" to deter Russia and help bring this conflict to an end.   More weapons, more money to fight, and, crucially, more support to join NATO, the Western military alliance where an attack on one member commits all to respond,",Russian President Volodymyr Zelensky visits the front lines of the eastern Ukraine war. Zelensky insists on going to the most forward,"Ukraine can not take on Russia and Russia can not take on NATO/US, but the world can not take on a nuclear war, so the war will be fought on European soil and cities, then when Russia starts losing ground, nuclear war will be fought on the rest of the world, and nobody will win..","Ukraine does not want to live in peace with its neighbour...

The Kremlin statement also confirmed that Biden ""suggested considering the possibility of holding a personal meeting at the highest level in the foreseeable future."" This is their second known call since Biden took office in January. In March, Biden had also invited Putin to be part of a leaders summit on climate later this month. The relationship between the world leaders got off to a tumultuous start, with the US adjusting its posture with Russia by finalizing sanctions in the wake of the poisoning and jailing of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, the SolarWinds hack and its placing of bounties on US troops serving in Afghanistan. During an interview in March, Biden called Putin a killer, saying that the RussiaIn leader ""will pay a price"" for his efforts to undermine the 2020 US election. In response, the Kremlin recalled its ambassador to the US for the first time in more than 20 years.

NYT,Inflation,1,Jump in Consumer Prices Raises Stakes in Inflation Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/12/business/inflation-consumer-price-index-april.html,"The increase in the Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index was well above forecasts. A top Fed official acknowledged the surprise but said, “This is one data point.”Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Jeanna SmialekConsumer prices jumped at the fastest pace in more than a decade in April, surprising economists and intensifying a debate on Wall Street and in Washington over whether inflation might reach levels that would squeeze households and ultimately undermine the recovery.Economists and central bank officials said the numbers reflected pandemic-driven trends that would most likely prove temporary. But investors and politicians are worried that prices will keep climbing — potentially pressuring the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates sharply. That could slow economic growth and send stock prices plummeting.On Wednesday, stocks slumped more than 2 percent, their biggest decline since late February, after the government reported in the morning that the closely monitored Consumer Price Index climbed 4.2 percent in April from a year earlier, its fastest pace since 2008.Hanging over the debate is America’s inflationary experience in the 1960s and 1970s, when big government spending, an oil crisis, a slow-moving Fed and the final end of the gold standard converged to send price gains to double-digit heights. The central bank got things under control only by lifting interest rates to punishing levels, at a grave cost to the housing market and ultimately the job market.Few analysts expect a return to such huge price gains, in part because the Fed has pledged to act to keep inflation under control. But if officials are prodded to withdraw economic support quickly in order to prevent another “Great Inflation,” it could spur a downturn, as sudden Fed changes have done in the past.Yet many economists, including advisers to the White House and Fed officials themselves, played down the concern that the inflation gains will last past the end of this year. The specifics of Wednesday’s report instead backed up the Fed’s belief that the rapid price increases will probably fade with time, several said, because they trace back to the economy’s reopening from the pandemic.“This is one data point,” Richard H. Clarida, the Fed’s vice chair, cautioned shortly after the data release, noting that it might take time for supply to catch up with demand as the economy reopens.Even so, he struck a somewhat cautious tone, acknowledging that the number came as a “surprise” and saying the Fed will remain watchful to make sure the increase is temporary.Prices for used cars, plane tickets and furniture are all rising as the economy reopens, contributing to the increase. The jump also reflected the fact that prices tumbled a year ago when state and local governments instituted stay-at-home orders, causing spending to sharply slump. The report’s details told a story of resurging demand while supply is constrained, and at an uncertain and volatile juncture — the economy has never reopened from a pandemic shutdown before.April 2021: +4.2%+4%+3Percent change in Consumer Price Index from a year ago+2+1201920202021Some of April’s jump can be explained through what’s known as base effects — prices fell significantly last spring, so the increase now from the year prior is larger.2021 Consumer Price Index2652602020255JanAprilJulyOct.April 2021: +4.2%+4%+3Percent change in Consumer Price Index from a year ago+2+1201920202021Some of April’s jump can be explained through what’s known as base effects — prices fell significantly last spring, so the increase now from the year prior is larger.2021 Consumer Price Index2652602020255JanAprilJulyOct.Notes: C.P.I. of 100 is equal to prices in 1984.Source: Bureau of Labor StatisticsBy Ella KoezeBut the report fueled investor concerns that price gains might be more pronounced and lasting than the Fed anticipates. Financial markets reacted sourly: Yields on government bonds jumped and stock prices tumbled for the third day in a row.“There is a lot of concern that the Fed is behind the curve on this, that prices and wages are going up,” said Alan Detmeister, a former central bank inflation forecaster who now works at the bank U.B.S. Mr. Detmeister said he too expected the price increases would fade, but noted that the larger-than-expected April gain “feeds into that narrative.”On a monthly basis, inflation rose by 0.8 percent. A narrower measure of prices, which strips out food and energy costs that can be volatile, rose 0.9 percent — its biggest monthly increase since April 1982.The data gave Republicans a new opening to attack President Biden’s handling of the economic recovery. They have repeatedly warned that trillions of dollars of spending by the Biden administration risked overheating the economy.Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, said in a release on Wednesday that the report “further confirms our fears” and that","Consumer prices jumped at the fastest pace in more than a decade in April.

Prices rose 0.7 percent compared with the prior month, the biggest increase in two decades.The pickup in inflation is coming as rebounding demand and supply shortages push costs higher, along with data quirks that are increasing the annual number: That data point is jumping higher partly as the price index laps very low readings from last year’s spring shutdown. The inflation gauge is closely watched because it is the Federal Reserve’s favorite, and officials are carefully monitoring the pickup in prices as the economy reopens.The Fed aims for 2 percent annual inflation, on average over time. Price gains are well above that now, but central bankers and economists expect that pickup will probably fade with time as producers catch up with consumer demand and the boost from government stimulus disappears.Having a core gauge of “inflation at a 29-year high won’t faze the Fed, yet,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note following the release. “We expect most Fed officials — and especially the governors — to stick to the line that inflation pressures are expected to be ‘transitory’ or ‘transient,’ due to ‘bottlenecks.’”The report showed that personal income declined sharply in April as a jump caused by stimulus payments in March faded, something that was broadly expected. Income fell by 13.1 percent, actually a smaller decrease than the 14.2 percent drop economists had anticipated.Personal spending rose 0.5 percent, a slow but steady pace, but that improvement eroded when counting for price increases. In a surprise to economists, spending actually declined slightly when adjusted for inflation, falling by 0.1 percent — missing the 0.2 percent gain they had penciled in.“The combination of falling real consumption and soaring prices last month gives off a faint whiff of stagflation,” Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note following the release. There was some pickup in services spending, but he noted that the pace was “a bit of a disappointment given the removal of most Covid-related restrictions.”But Gennadiy Goldberg, a rates strategist at T.D. Securities, said that because the inflation pickup is likely to fade with time, it makes more sense to focus on the acceleration in the headline index — and the overall takeaway there is that people are reopening their pocketbooks.“That data is still going through stimulus, post-stimulus check volatility,” Mr. Goldberg said. “Are consumers spending? I think the data is telling us that yes, they are.”The figures are the latest to underline that the economy is in for a bumpy ride as it reopens from months of state and local lockdowns meant to contain the coronavirus pandemic. The Fed, which is tasked with maintaining stable prices and is supposed to foster full employment, has signaled that it is willing to look through the current run-up in inflation as the economy heals and moves through such an unusual period.But the central bank has also signaled that if price gains prove persistent or get out of control, it would act. That could mean a quicker pullback from mass bond-buying or interest rate increases, policies the central bank is now using to support the economy by keeping a wide range of borrowing costs low. Both bond purchases and low rates support asset prices, so markets have been on edge about the possibility of faster inflation that prompts the Fed to reduce its economic support.Revised data released Friday showed that the University of Michigan’s consumer inflation expectations indexes were elevated in May, with Americans anticipating higher prices both in the near term and over the next five years. The index for inflation expectations over that longer time horizon came in at 3 percent, the highest since 2013. Top Fed officials have a history of watching the Michigan data series.Politicians have been talking about price changes daily since an earlier and related inflation release — the Consumer Price Index report — showed that inflation picked up more than expected in April.Republicans paint the inflation as a sign that big government spending is coming at a cost, while Democrats say it is a temporary phenomenon, driven by data quirks and the fact that demand is bouncing back and supply must rise to meet it. They argue short-lived bigger price gains are no reason to change course.The question now for both the White House and th","Personal consumption expenditure inflation measure climbed 3.6 percent in April from the year through April.

Anyone can read what you share.By Jeanna SmialekConsumer prices rose in May at the fastest rate since 2008, a bigger jump than economists had expected and one that is sure to keep inflation at the center of political and economic debate in Washington.The Consumer Price Index surged 5 percent in May from a year earlier, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists had expected an increase of 4.7 percent. Prices rose 0.6 percent from April to May, and an index that excludes volatile food and energy costs rose 3.8 percent from a year earlier, the briskest pace since 1992.Prices are rising for many goods and services, as varied as airfares and used cars, the result of bottlenecks and strong consumer demand as a pandemic-stricken economy comes roaring back. Government officials and many economists have said much of the jump is likely to fade with time as the economy gets past a reopening bounce and supply catches up. The annual number in particular is getting a boost from what’s called a base effect: The year-ago figure was depressed by shutdowns, so the current readings look large by comparison.May 2021: +5%+5%+4Percent change in Consumer Price Index from a year prior+3+2+1201920202021Some of May’s jump can be explained through what’s known as base effects — prices fell significantly last spring, so the increase now from the year prior is larger.2702021 Consumer Price Index2652602020255JanAprilJulyOct.May 2021: +5%+5%+4+3Percent change in Consumer Price Index from a year prior+2+1201920202021Some of May’s jump can be explained through what’s known as base effects — prices fell significantly last spring, so the increase now from the year prior is larger.2702021 Consumer Price Index2652602020255JanAprilJulyOct.Notes: C.P.I. of 100 is equal to prices in 1984.Sources: Bureau of Labor StatisticsBy Ella KoezeBut the big monthly figure for May, on the heels of a sharp rise in April, showed that prices have been moving up quickly for more than just technical reasons. The critical question is whether those stronger-than-expected price pressures are a transient trend tied to reopening or something more persistent.“We are at peak heat, this is the moment,” said Julia Coronado, founder of the research firm MacroPolicy Perspectives. “We know we’ll get a fade — the question is, how big is the fade?”Ms. Coronado, like many economists, expects inflation to settle down and remain in line with the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent average goal over time. The Fed uses a different index, the Personal Consumption Expenditures measure, to define its target. That gauge is closely linked to C.P.I., though it tends to run slightly below it.The stakes are high on both Wall Street and Main Street. Inflation can erode purchasing power if wages do not keep up. A short-lived burst would be unlikely to cause lasting damage, but an entrenched one could force the Fed to reduce its support for the economy, potentially tanking stocks and risking a fresh recession.Washington’s next policy steps could also hinge on what happens with prices. Republicans are using the numbers to argue that big spending on pandemic relief, along with additional spending on infrastructure, which the administration proposes paying for largely with tax increases, would be imprudent.“It ought to have a sobering effect on anyone who digs in their heels that somehow the country needs more stimulus, or that the country needs more free money,” said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota and a member of the Senate Banking Committee. The pandemic continues to impact the U.S. economy in a multitude of ways. One key factor to keep an eye on is the job market and how it changes as the economic recovery moves forward.The government’s debt pile is already at record levels. The Treasury Department said on Thursday that the federal budget deficit hit $2.1 trillion for the first eight months of the fiscal year in May, the highest ever. That is a 10 percent increase from 2020 and reflects the government response to the pandemic, including stimulus payments and funds for state and local governments. The monthly deficit in May was $132 billion, a decline from a year ago, when tax payments were delayed until July.The White House does not see inflation as a reason to temper its infrastructure and jobs proposals, a senior administration official said, since that spending would roll out over several years and involve longer-term investments. The administration also took solace in the market reaction to the new price data, which it saw as a sign that the pickup is widely expected to be temporary.Investors were unmoved by the inflation data, suggesting they had already penciled in higher prices and did not think the data fundamentally changed the outlook for Fed policy.

Here in Washington, we’ve heard countless speeches and promises, and white papers from experts. But today, we’re finally getting this done. So my message to the American people is this: America is moving again, and your life is going to change for the better. Given half a chance, the American people have never, ever, ever let this nation down, and it’s our job to give our people that chance. It’s our job to come together and make sure we remain a nation of possibilities. Let’s remember this day. Let’s remember we can come together. Most of all, let’s remember what we’ve gotten done for the American people when we do come together. I truly believe that 50 years from now, historians are going to look back at this moment and say, ‘That’s the moment America began to win the competition of the 21st century.’”By Michael D. ShearWASHINGTON — For more than an hour on Monday, President Biden enjoyed the kind of political moment he had eagerly sought and long promised, surrounded by a bipartisan cast of lawmakers on the South Lawn of the White House for the signing of landmark legislation forged through compromise at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.But after completing the signing ceremony for the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, Mr. Biden returns to a much harsher reality: historically low approval ratings, unified Republican opposition to the centerpiece of his domestic policy, growing alarm in his party about the prospect of losing control of Congress next year and a surprising surge in inflation.The president and his aides are hoping that the highly choreographed event will begin to allow Mr. Biden to find his footing. They are betting that the bipartisan victory will allow him to project sustained progress in confronting the nation’s problems — not just being different from former President Donald J. Trump.“I truly believe that 50 years from now, historians are going to look back at this moment and say, That is the moment America began to win the competition for the 21st century,” Mr. Biden said, standing before hundreds of mayors, governors, lawmakers and others with the White House gleaming on a brisk and sunny Washington afternoon behind him.To chants of “Joe! Joe! Joe!” Mr. Biden called the infrastructure bill “proof that despite the cynics, Democrats and Republicans can come together and deliver results.”But the president and his top advisers also understand the uncertainty in the country’s deeply polarized electorate, the difficult battles yet to come on Capitol Hill and the often fleeting nature of political victories in the age of 280-character messages on Twitter and vanishing stories on Instagram.Will Monday’s victory be the steppingstone that Mr. Biden needs for a political turnaround, proving to voters that they got what they expected when they put him in office last year? Or will it be a blip in time, destined to be quickly forgotten among the Washington rancor that is on the way in the days ahead?“It is a victory in which Biden’s leadership really mattered,” said Matt Bennett, a senior executive for Third Way, a Democratic-leaning group that presses lawmakers in both parties to work together. “That could signal that this is the beginning of a real virtuous circle for him.”But Mr. Bennett, who attended the signing ceremony, added that the real test for Mr. Biden will be “shaping the public narrative on the enormous benefits of the infrastructure act that is being signed today.”“That is going to require enormous discipline on the part not only of the president,” he said, “but also congressional Democrats.”The outcome could help determine the fate of Mr. Biden’s presidency and the course of the Democratic Party as lawmakers prepare to defend their slim majorities in the House and the Senate in next year’s midterm elections.Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and one of 10 senators who worked to shape the infrastructure compromise, praised Mr. Biden and Democrats in Congress.“This is what can happen when Republicans and Democrats decide we’re going to work together to get something done,” said Mr. Portman, who is not running for re-election. (Mr. Biden later called Mr. Portman “a hell of a good guy,” adding that he could only say that without hurting him politically because of the senator’s decision not to seek another term.)Monday’s signing ceremony was the culmination of a long effort for Mr. Biden.

NYT,Inflation,5,Inflation in Britain climbs to a 10-year high.,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/business/britain-inflation.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur,"Inflation in Britain rose to its highest level in nearly a decade in October after soaring energy prices hit household bills.The Consumer Price Index rose 4.2 percent from a year earlier, the highest since November 2011, and up from 3.1 percent in September, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. The price increases were more than twice the central bank’s target of 2 percent, increasing the likelihood that policymakers will go ahead with the interest rate increases they have signaled are coming.The biggest contributor to higher inflation was a surge in energy costs, including wholesale natural gas, which has caused nearly two dozen energy suppliers in Britain to collapse and disrupted manufacturers. The cap on energy bills, which protects about 15 million households, was raised 12 percent in October.Other large contributors were higher prices for gasoline and at hotels and restaurants, the statistics agency said.The Bank of England has said it expects inflation to peak at about 5 percent in the spring. “This period of higher inflation is likely to be temporary,” Andrew Bailey, the central bank’s governor, said this month. But there is “no fixed unit of time” that defines transitory, he said.The central bank said that “it would be necessary over coming months” to raise interest rates if the economic data played out as policymakers anticipated, especially if the end of the government’s furlough program didn’t result in a large increase in unemployment. In the three months through September, the unemployment rate was 4.3 percent, 0.2 of a percentage point lower than in the three months through July, and early payroll data indicated that only a small number of people lost their jobs in October when the furlough program expired.As the global economy emerged from successive lockdowns over the past year, supply bottlenecks, labor market shortages and other shortages have disrupted supply chains around the world. Policymakers are warning that the supply problems and the higher prices that result will last longer than they initially expected, adding pressure on central bankers to act more aggressively to stop inflation from getting out of their control.In the United States, the Consumer Price Index jumped 6.2 percent in October from a year earlier, the fastest annual increase since 1990, and prices rose 4.1 percent in the eurozone last month, the fastest in 13 years. In China, the prices wholesalers pay to producers climbed to the highest in 26 years amid rising commodity prices and power shortages.","Consumer Price Index rose 4.2 percent from a year earlier, the highest since November 2011.

WP,Inflation,1,Fed estimates inflation will grow faster than projected just 3 months ago and moves up expectations for rate hike,https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/06/16/fed-powell-inflation-unemployment-june-meeting/,"The Federal Reserve expects inflation will climb to 3.4 percent this year, higher than the central bank’s previous forecasts, while also projecting for the first time that there could be two interest rate hikes in 2023.The predictions, released Wednesday after the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, depict a delicate but mostly upbeat narrative of where central bankers think the economy is headed, as well as a serious revamp of predictions from just three months earlier.In March, the Fed predicted inflation would be 2.4 percent for this year. Moreover, earlier Fed estimates didn’t project an initial interest rate hike until 2024.Ask The Post: What questions do you have about the economy and inflation?The new snapshots of the economy come as the Fed and White House are facing increasing criticism from the GOP and some economists that trillions of dollars of stimulus spending, combined with low interest rates and the Fed’s other economic supports, are now overheating and endangering the economy.For its part, the Fed expects prices for certain goods and services to continue to rise over the next few months, especially in industries with backlogged supply chains. However, the Fed also expects that the labor market will keep building strength. And while the central bank isn’t ready to stem inflation by raising interest rates just yet, Chair Jerome H. Powell sent the message that the Fed is keeping a close eye on inflation.“Shifts in demand can be large and rapid,” Powell said at a Wednesday news conference. “Inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect.”FAQ: Why inflation is rising and whether you should worryPowell added that the Fed would be ready to respond quickly if inflation is broader or more persistent than officials currently think. On Wednesday, the Fed kept interest rates near zero, as expected.The news that the Fed planned to end record-low interest rates sooner than projected weighed on markets. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 266 points or 0.8 percent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 33 points or 0.2 percent.Overall, the Fed’s latest projections showed a more optimistic take on the economic recovery. Officials expect economic growth to hit 7 percent this year, which would be the fastest calendar-year expansion since 1984, up from the 6.5 percent growth projection the Fed released in March.The Fed also pointed to more widespread coronavirus vaccinations for helping boost economic activity and employment. The labor market is still healing from the depths of the pandemic and has yet to recover 7 million jobs. Yet according to the Fed’s estimates, the unemployment rate could fall to a pre-pandemic level of 3.5 percent by 2023.“I am confident that we are on a path to a very strong labor market,” Powell said.Recent benchmarks have shown an increase in consumer prices, including for products like used cars and lumber. However, officials from the Fed and the Biden administration say those increases are largely expected as the economy emerges from the sharp, pandemic-induced downturn, when prices dropped.A separate measure of inflation, released earlier this month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that prices rose 5 percent in May compared with a year ago. A large share of May’s inflation gains came from the car market. The price of used cars and trucks continued to surge, rising 7.3 percent in May compared with April. That followed a 10 percent increase in April.Rising prices: What meat, clothing and five other everyday items tell us about inflationOn Wednesday, Powell said he expected certain categories — like planes, hotels and lumber — would see their prices simmer down over time.“We expect those prices will get back up to where they were, but there’s no reason to think they‘re going to keep going up a lot,” Powell said. “Because if they are, people will build new hotels; there’s no reason for supply and demand to be out of whack in the hotel business over any period of time.”However, Republican lawmakers argue that the Fed could lag behind the curve when it decides to raise interest rates and that inflation could jump to dangerous levels in the meantime. “We are seeing substantial increases in inflation, which means the prices of everyday goods are going up for families in Florida and across the nation,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said. “Government shouldn’t work this way.”Joining that chorus is former treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers, a Democrat who has said that policymakers are critically underestimating inflation’s threat to the economy and that they need to adjust their policies to meet reality.The current treasury secretary, Janet L. Yellen, responded to Republican criticism Wednesday while testifying before a Senate committee hearing.“As the economy is opening back up again, prices are now moving back toward normal levels in leisure, hospitality, airfare and the like.

So far, they’re the most “powerful” critiques of President Biden’s agenda.That’s advice that top Democrats are receiving about selling the Biden agenda from Build Back Together, one of the main outside groups bolstering the president, according to a confidential memo from the organization obtained by The Washington Post.Their focus-group-approved tips urge surrogates, consultants and pro-Biden influencers to talk about the practical benefits of Biden’s agenda, warning that many Americans are not familiar with it. That gap in knowledge could prove problematic — particularly as Republicans have been trying to define Democrats as tax-and-spend socialists out to remake the country’s relationship with government.“Americans of all political stripes support these economic policies [but] current polling tells us that voters know little about them,” according to a July 20 memo from the group. “To build support for the Build Back Better agenda, it is imperative to talk to voters directly about the best-testing aspects of the plans.”To remedy the situation and get the word out about Biden’s agenda, Democrats are encouraged to focus on his attempts to usher in better jobs and lower health-care and education costs.“Don’t forget: always talk about how the plans are paid for,” the document says, reiterating that Biden has pledged not to increase the tax burden on anyone making less than $400,000 and that taxes on corporations and the ultrawealthy will foot this bill. “Messaging that includes language about pay-fors consistently outperforms in testing.”Some Democratic moderates have worried that the scale and ambition of Biden’s legislative agenda could turn off voters in the suburbs, where higher taxes are generally frowned upon.Dan Sena, a Democratic strategist who led the 2018 effort to take back the House, said voters knowing how things will be paid for and by whom is important, since front-line members need to find a way to reframe the Republican attacks on tax increases.“You have got to get proactive about it. You have got to have some way to get ahead of it,” he said.One Democratic member of Congress from a challenging district, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations among colleagues, said there had been concern in the caucus about the size of the spending and tax package that is being drafted to accompany the bipartisan infrastructure bill.“I don’t agree with the thesis that the American public loves taxes and spending, and I think we have to be very careful on both fronts,” this person said, citing the concern of voters that they will ultimately be stuck with the bill. “I generally believe that people think that it will eventually get to them. I am not sure that I subscribe to the view that it is just the other guys who gets hit with new taxes.”This member and others anticipate an intraparty negotiation over the coming months about the size and scope of the package, in which these divisions will be forced to the fore. One group of Democrats from high-tax states is expected to push hard for a reinstatement of the state and local tax deduction that Republicans limited in 2017. Rep. Sean Maloney (D-N.Y.), the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has indicated that reinstating the deduction, which mostly benefits wealthier families, will be important for many battleground districts, largely in suburban areas.Republicans previewed the message that they will use against Democrats. “House Democrats have adopted a plan for electoral disaster,” said Michael McAdams, the National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman. “Embracing massive tax hikes and causing inflation to skyrocket.”Democrats recognize that a focus on inflation poses problems.“The NRCC produced one of the first inflation spots we’ve seen and it was one of the most powerful Republican ads to date,” according to the Democratic memo. “Notably, they did more damage with this ad than nearly any other conservative ad tested and they were able to do it in [15 seconds] instead of a typical [30 seconds].”The group linked to an ad that was run against Rep. Cindy Axne (D-Iowa). “Burgers, buns, propane, gas — this year your Fourth of July is more expensive because Democrats’ harmful economic policies are making everyday goods cost more,” says a narrator, who then urges viewers to call Axne and tell her: “We can’t afford this.”The Biden team has acknowledged that prices have increased. And it is blaming higher costs on a combination of an unexpected chip shortage that is causing a major increase in the cost of vehicles and the temporary effect of prices in categories such as hotels and travel moving back to normal ranges after being depressed last year.“The vast majority of the ex","Top Democrats are receiving advice from Build Back Together, one of the main outside groups bolstering the president's agenda.

WP,Inflation,3,Prices rise 5.4 percent in July over last year as the economy claws back from pandemic depths,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/11/july-prices-cpi-inflation-fed/,"Prices rose 5.4 percent in July compared with a year ago, as policymakers at the Federal Reserve and the Biden administration grapple with how long — and how high — inflation could climb as the economy rebounds.Data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday showed prices rose 0.5 percent in July compared with June, a slight easing of the monthly pace of inflation.For months, the Fed and White House have said inflation will keep climbing as consumer demand surges while supply chains struggle to catch up. Their expectation is that as supply backlogs have time to clear, inflation will settle back down closer to the Fed’s 2 percent annual target.But that message is increasingly difficult to grasp for households facing rising grocery bills, rent or expensive airline tickets. The longer it takes for supply chains to clear up or for pandemic-battered sectors to reboot, the tougher it may be for consumers to swallow higher prices.Does everything really cost more? Find out with our inflation quiz.As more people hit the road during summertime, gas prices are on an upward climb, the inflation report showed. On Wednesday, the White House called on global oil producers to boost production.The cost of many grocery items — including meats, poultry, eggs and dairy — also ticked higher again in July, according to the report. Groceries have been trending higher for well over a year, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing a 2.6 percent rise in the “food at home” category compared with last year.Prices rise 5.4 percent in June over last year, largest spike since 2008For the Fed and White House, price challenges are compounded by the fact that inflation can be driven by what people expect it will be in the future. For example, if businesses shift their plans for investment or consumers change their spending habits because they think prices for construction materials or hotel rooms will continue to soar, that behavior could drive prices up, too.Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said it matters to households that “we’re on month five of this, and we might be in for another year of it.”“I think the Fed could be less dismissive of the concern,” Strain said. “The Fed may be absolutely right to keep its zero interest rate policy. But I think the Fed has been too blasé, too serene, too dismissive of this potential risk.”Meanwhile, Republicans have long argued that inflation is an urgent concern and that the Fed will be too late once it decides prices have reached dangerous levels. Conservatives were also quick to chastise Senate Democrats for adopting a $3.5 trillion budget early Wednesday morning, saying such massive spending will heat up the economy even more.FAQ: Why inflation is rising and whether you should worryFor now, survey data isn’t suggesting baked-in expectations for widespread, sustained inflation over the long term. But the Fed is on alert for any signs suggesting otherwise.“All the evidence is that it’s not happening,” Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said last month. “But, nonetheless, we have to watch this very carefully. … Price stability for us means inflation averaging 2 percent over time. And so we’ve got to be very careful about that.”July’s top-line inflation figure of 5.4 percent was the same as the June reading. Economists and policymakers have been looking for any clues that suggest the breakneck pace of price growth is beginning to cool down. But they are also hesitant to jump to conclusions too quickly, especially since there’s no playbook for this recovery.“One month does not make a trend … and we know supply constraints persist in various sectors,” the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers tweeted Wednesday.A look at used cars illustrates some inflation dynamics at play. Demand for cars is high, but supply has been hampered by ongoing chip shortages. The consequence of that mismatch is hard to miss: Compared with last year, prices for used cars and trucks have soared 41.7 percent.But a look at the month-to-month data suggests prices are not climbing as fast as they had been for much of this year. For example, used car prices jumped 10.5 percent in June compared with May. But in July, they grew only 0.2 percent, compared with June.Similarly, the cost of hotels and motels are still high as travelers rebook vacations. But the rate of price growth eased a bit in July compared with June. In June, prices rose 7.9 percent compared with the month before. In July, they rose 6.8 percent over the same period.Still, economists and policymakers are staying alert for any signs of sustained price increases that pulse through the entire economy. For example, rising rents and soaring home prices have concerned some economists who are unsure whether the cost of shelter will fall back down. (Rent rose 0.2 percent in July, mirroring figures from the month before.)The U.S. economy added 943,000 jobs in July, as the labor market recovery b","Prices rose 0.5 percent in July compared with June, a slight easing of 0.5 percent in July.

WP,Inflation,4,"Prices rise 5.3 percent in August over last year, in early sign that inflation could be easing",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/09/14/august-inflation/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social,"Prices rose 5.3 percent in August compared with a year ago, as inflation showed early signs of easing amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Data released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that prices rose 0.3 percent in August compared with July.The August data breaks an eight-month streak of rising or steady inflation — and is a welcome sign for policymakers at the Fed and the White House, who argue that inflation will start to cool down as the economy heals. Their expectation is that as supply chains catch up with consumer demand, prices will land closer to the Fed’s 2 percent annual target for inflation.But there’s still plenty of uncertainty about whether the shift will stick.Biden shifts pitch for economic plans as GOP escalates attacks over high pricesFor starters, there’s no guarantee that inflation will continue to tick down. Policymakers within the Biden administration and the Fed say they need months of data to understand how the pandemic is affecting inflation, and for how long. Plus, prices for specific categories — such as meat, rent or used cars — won’t necessarily follow the same patterns.On Tuesday, the Council of Economic Advisers tweeted that the slight slowdown in August was “encouraging.” But the CEA added a note of caution: “continued economic disruptions from the pandemic may continue to impact inflation in months to come in either direction.”Senior administration officials point to the month-to-month figures as their preferred snapshot of inflation, because that data can surface immediate trends and improvements to supply chains that have been backlogged for months. There were some encouraging hints that prices in hard-hit sectors were cooling down compared to earlier this summer.For example, over the past year, prices for used cars and trucks have taken up a huge share of inflation, in large part due to chip shortages. Overall, prices for the vehicles are up nearly 32 percent compared with last year. But from July to August, prices for used cars and trucks fell 1.5 percent.Similarly, prices for hotels and motels fell 3.3 percent from July to August. Airline fares fell 9.1 percent over the same period. Even rent, which some economists feared would keep rising as home values soared, rose only 0.3 percent over the previous month.The data is likely to bolster Democrats’ arguments that more government spending won’t push inflation even higher. Republicans have chastised the White House and congressional Democrats for trying to pass another sprawling legislative package, saying it will heat up the economy even more. Conservatives also say the Federal Reserve should step in now to combat inflation by raising interest rates and yanking back support for the markets.But part of Biden’s pitch is that his spending plans target rising prices in the long term. White House officials say that investing in stronger child-care options for families and physical infrastructure repairs, everyday costs for working-class families will come down.The August inflation report wasn’t enough to soothe Wall Street by Tuesday’s close. The markets jumped shortly after the data released. But they gave up those gains by late afternoon, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 300 points.Many left-leaning economists and government officials say inflation is “transitory,” meaning it doesn’t reflect persistent, widespread price increases that pulse through the whole economy. But that message could be increasingly hard to grasp for millions of households facing steep price tags for groceries, used cars or gas right now.How the delta variant stole Christmas: Empty shelves, long waits — and yes, higher pricesPlus, economists are closely monitoring people’s perceptions of inflation. If Americans expect the cost of goods and services to stay high, they may be more likely to buy furniture or plane tickets before the cost stings even worse. That cycle of behavior only pushes prices higher, making inflation expectations self-fulfilling.A survey released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that Americans’ inflation expectations are at record highs. One year from now, people expect inflation will be at 5.2 percent, according to the August Survey of Consumer Expectations. The month before, that survey measure was 4.9 percent.Biden’s vaccine push wins cautious business support as political opponents fumeJoe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, said the latest inflation figures were a “real victory for team transitory.” He added that the cost of shelter — namely rental prices that didn’t escalate — also offered a dose of relief for Fed officials, even as the broader housing industry is still being shaped by the pandemic economy.“If we are going to observe a broadening of inflation that puts at risk Fed policy and price stability, it’s going to be via the housing market, and that’s just not happening right now,” Brusuelas said.In the backdrop, the Fed is figuring out when to start pulling back on ",The data breaks an eight-month streak of rising or steady inflation.

WP,Inflation,5,"Prices climbed 6.2 percent in October compared with last year, largest rise in 3 decades, as inflation strains economy",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/11/10/cpi-inflation-october/,"Prices rose 6.2 percent in October compared with a year ago, the largest annual increase in about 30 years, as rising inflation complicates the political agenda for the White House and policymakers’ road map for the economy heading into the end of the year.The growth in October prices reported Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was driven by soaring energy prices and ongoing supply chain backlogs, such as those in the used-car market. Gasoline prices are up 49.6 percent from a year earlier, and higher energy costs are pushing up the prices of just about every other good, economists say, pinching an already strained supply chain.A surge that began in narrow sectors now appears to be spreading throughout the economy, with the BLS noting “broad-based” higher prices propelled by not just energy and used cars, but also by shelter, food and new vehicles. Prices for medical care, household furnishing and operations, and recreation all increased in October.Overall prices rose 0.9 percent from September to October, tying June for the biggest one-month increase since the Great Recession. Only a few categories saw prices fall last month, including airfare and alcohol.The data underscores how inflation has emerged as a controversial political and economic issue during the pandemic era. For years, inflation remained tamely below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent annual target and off politicians’ radar. But the clash of supply chain backlogs, labor shortages, and ongoing uncertainty amid a public health crisis has turned inflation into a crucial test for policymakers and economists — and it’s unclear when that will change.“This was the first number that very clearly was not ‘temporary shortage’ driven,” said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, suggesting that the pandemic-era supply shortages are no longer the sole, overwhelming force. “There were things that are no longer short, coming back up in price. Services that by definition aren’t really short, coming up in price.”The latest snapshot of higher prices comes at a tense time for the Biden administration, as it tries to corral support for a $2 trillion social spending package. On Wednesday morning, a key Democrat needed for the bill, Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), raised new concerns about inflation, building on his earlier warnings about more government spending.President Biden tried to assuage these fears Wednesday, highlighting good news in the economy — including lower weekly claims for jobless benefits — while also suggesting his economic agenda, including the package Congress recently passed to boost infrastructure spending, will bring down prices.“Inflation hurts Americans pocketbooks, and reversing this trend is a top priority for me,” Biden said in a statement.But officials at the White House and the Fed have for months asserted inflation will be a temporary, or “transitory,” feature of the economy. They argue that the price increases are driven by supply chain backlogs that have constrained auto manufacturing, housing construction and food production alike. Inflation won’t come down to more sustainable levels, they argue, until those supply chains have time to clear.Inside America’s Broken Supply ChainIt’s unclear when that will happen, especially given how vulnerable the economy remains to the coronavirus pandemic and its waves, which add unpredictable pressure to the supply chain overseas and domestically. At a news conference last week, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said “it is very difficult to predict the persistence of supply constraints or their effects on inflation. Global supply chains are complex; they will return to normal function, but the timing of that is highly uncertain.”Some economists are also concerned that while wages are climbing, they aren’t growing enough to compensate for the rising cost of living, at least in the short term.Many of the items U.S. households rely on each day are seeing sharp price increases, BLS data shows. In the past 12 months, the national average price of a dozen grade A eggs rose from $1.41 to $1.82, a 29 percent increase. An average pound of chuck roast rose 29 percent, from $5.75 to $7.40. A gallon of milk rose 8 percent, from $3.38 to $3.66. However, many other items, such as cheddar and American cheese and produce like tomatoes and strawberries, got cheaper over the same period.Rent continues to inch upward, with costs rising 0.4 percent in October compared with September, following a months-long upward trend. Home prices also continue to grow, which some economists say has the effect of pulling rents up higher over time. The median sales price of single-family existing homes climbed 16 percent from one year ago, to $363,700, according to data released Wednesday by the National Association of Realtors.“The Fed has to be laser focused on the hardest-hit and low-wage households,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “Wages and salaries have gon","Prices rose 0.9 percent from September to October, tying June for the largest annual increase since the Great Recession.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File PhotoNEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Investors are betting that newly renominated Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will need to step up the pace at which the central bank is normalizing monetary policy to better grapple with surging consumer prices.For months, Powell has insisted the current bout of inflation is likely to be transitory, and said the central bank will be ""patient"" in deciding when to begin raising its benchmark rate from near-zero. The Fed kicked off the taper of its $120 billion per month bond buying program in November, with a plan to end purchases altogether in mid-2022.  read more Some investors, however, believe the Fed will need to taper faster and raise rates sooner than expected to tame rising consumer prices, which grew at the quickest pace in more than three decades in October. Their view has been reinforced by recent public debate among some Fed officials on whether to withdraw support for the economy more quickly to help tame inflation.  read more One barometer of investors’ monetary policy expectations, futures on the federal funds rate, on Monday afternoon had priced in a 100% chance that the central bank will raise rates by July, from 92% last week.News of Powell’s nomination on Monday also sent yields on shorter-dated Treasuries, which are more sensitive to rate views, to their highest level since early 2020. Powell is widely seen as more hawkish than Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who was also vying for the top job.  read more Investors are ""challenging the Fed to some extent and becoming more concerned about the Fed falling behind the curve on inflation,"" said Mike Sewell, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price.Sewell is buying shorter-dated Treasuries and the U.S. dollar, betting that the Fed will need to raise rates three times next year to tame inflation. The central bank’s dot-plot, released in September, showed half of policymakers penciling in one rate increase next year.Analysts at Jefferies wrote Monday’s rise in Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, “is predicated on the idea that the prospects for a June 2022 rate hike have increased significantly on the back of Powell's renomination,” though the bank believes a June rate increase is unlikely.Bets on shorter-dated Treasuries have also drawn Gary Cloud, a portfolio manager of the Hennessy Equity and Income Fund.""We're in an era that investors haven't seen before because you have a significant uncertainty as to whether the Fed will act in time"" to prevent inflation from spiraling higher, he said.Diverging views on how aggressively the Fed will move have helped stir volatility in Treasury markets. The ICE Bank of America MOVE Index (.MOVE), which shows expectations of volatility in the bond market, stands near its highest levels since April 2020.Inflation expectations edged lower on Monday, with 5- and 10-year breakeven inflation rates dipping to their lowest in about two weeks.Meanwhile, calls for the Fed to normalize monetary policy more aggressively are now coming from some of the central bank’s own policymakers, reinforcing many investors’ views.Vice Chair Richard Clarida said earlier this month that “a discussion about increasing the pace at which we are reducing our balance sheet” would be something to consider for the Fed's next meeting, while Fed Governor Christopher Waller called for the Fed to double up on its wind-down of bond purchases, finishing by April 2022 to make way for a possible interest-rate hike in the second quarter.  read more Powell, for his part, has said inflation will likely abate as supply chain bottlenecks that have contributed to higher prices eventually ease. There have been some indications that the worst of those disruptions are clearing up, with cargo shipping costs down by a third over the last month and prices for commodities such as iron ore and lumber tumbling.Others, however, insist inflation is headed higher. Adam Abbas, a portfolio manager and co-head of fixed income at Harris Associates, is buying the bonds of companies such as hotels, which may be able to better deflect the effects of higher inflation by raising prices.Donald Ellenberger, a senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes, expects bond market volatility to persist as inflation proves ""stickier"" than the Fed expected. He plans to focus on shorter-duration Treasuries until the 10-year note rises to 2.5% or higher, a level he sees as appropriate given inflation.""For many years the Treasury market was pretty sleepy and rates didn’t move very much,” he said. “Now the market doesn't know what to do when faced with the fact that inflation is persisting for longer than expected.”",Investors are betting that newly renominated Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will need to step up the pace at which it is normalizing.

They include firms in the consumer discretionary, industrial and manufacturing sectors.""We are very active with those clients, offering hedging protections,"" said the banker, who asked not to be named as client discussions are confidential.Clients that may need extra funding to get them through a period of higher inflation are being advised to raise capital while interest rates remain relatively low, the banker said.""It's still a very beneficial environment to be in if you need funding, but that won't last forever.""Investment bankers are also assessing whether higher inflation and monetary tightening could disrupt record deals and public offering pipelines.""We expect a sustained period of higher inflation, and monetary tightening could slow the momentum in the M&A market,"" said Paul Colone, U.S.-based managing partner at Alantra, a global mid-market investment bank.Alantra is advising clients in the early stages of M&A discussions ""to review the risks sustained inflation could bring to both valuation and business results,"" Colone said.Sales and trading teams, meanwhile, are taking more calls from clients looking to reposition portfolios, which are vulnerable to a loss in value.

Even though Washington insists higher inflation may just be temporary, America's prices keep rising — albeit at a slightly slower pace.The pace of consumer price inflation slowed some in July, but it still remained elevated, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday.While some of the culprits of the past months' inflation spikes, such as used car prices, came back down to earth in July, prices for other items, including food both in grocery stores and at restaurants, went through the roof.This serves as a reminder that the pandemic-era inflation weirdness is still alive and kicking.The price increases being caused by the reopening of the economy and ongoing supply chain bottlenecks will keep economists and investors, not to mention the Federal Reserve, on their toes.Price stability is one of the central bank's core mandates, and the pandemic-era inflation jump could force the Fed to rein in its easy money policy sooner rather than later. Higher food prices, lower used car pricesCore consumer prices, which strip out more volatile components like food and energy, rose 4.3% over the 12 months ended in July, slightly below June's rise. Overall, prices rose 5.4% over the period, flat compared with June when the index hit a 13-year high.In July alone, adjusted for seasonal swings, prices rose 0.5% on the whole and 0.3% without food and energy items, representing a slowdown on both fronts. Overall, it was the slowest pace of increases since February, while the core index advanced at the slowest pace since March. Cost increases for shelter, food, energy and new cars were the major contributors to the index's jump.The more modest price uptick in July ""indicates that the transitory burst of rising prices linked to reopening is fading and that ... core inflation may now have peaked,"" wrote Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics.A major driver of the July moderation was the price index for used cars, which was nearly unchanged from the prior month.This came as a surprise, given that used vehicle prices have soared in the past year as consumers were willing to pay a premium for mobility and new cars were in short supply amid a chip shortage. Over the past 12 months, the used car index is still up nearly 42%, a gain matched only by prices for gasoline.In other transportation news, the price index for airline fares also fell after rising sharply in past months as the reopening accelerated.Meanwhile, the cost of dining out jumped 0.8%, registering its largest monthly gain since February 1981, according to the BLS.Restaurants are raising prices to contend with higher costs of food as well as higher wages to retain employees amid a worker shortage. In June, Chipotle (CMG) announced it would raise its menu prices by 3.5% to 4%.

CNN,Inflation,3,UK inflation spikes at record rate in August,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/15/investing/uk-inflation/index.html?utm_content=2021-09-15T13%3A22%3A06&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twCNN&utm_term=link,"UK inflation rose at the fastest rate in at least 24 years in August as the price of transportation, restaurant meals and used cars spiked dramatically.The annual rate of inflation rose by 3.2% in August, up from 2% in the 12 months to July, Britain's Office for National Statistics (ONS) said Wednesday. The month-on-month increase is the largest recorded since the ONS began keeping records in January 1997.Some of the uplift reflected coronavirus relief programs that were in place last summer, such as sales tax reductions in the hospitality sector and the government's ""Eat Out to Help Out"" initiative, which heavily discounted restaurant meals.But the UK economy has also been facing sustained upward pressure on prices driven by worker shortages and snarled supply chains linked to the pandemic and Brexit. That is weighing on the economic recovery and could force the Bank of England to bring interest rate hikes forward if inflation remains above its 2% target for longer than expected.There were a record 1 million UK job vacancies in June to August and wages soared nearly 7% between May and July, according to the ONS. Rising wages come as companies are already contending with higher costs in their supply chains from raw materials shortages and soaring shipping rates. Restaurants, pubs and supermarkets, including Iceland Foods and Nando's, have had to close some locations due to staff shortages or because they have run out of ingredients. McDonald's (MCD) was forced to take milkshakes off its menu earlier this summer.Supply chain disruptions and worker shortages are hampering Britain's economic recovery. GDP growth slowed sharply in July, posting its smallest monthly increase since February, the ONS said last week. A 'whiff' of stagflationThe economy remains 2.1% smaller than before the pandemic and economists at Berenberg now expect it to make a full recovery in the second quarter of 2022 instead of the first. If prices continue rising, there is a risk that stagflation occurs, according to Berenberg senior economist Kallum Pickering, a phenomenon characterized by stubbornly high inflation and weak economic growth.""The recent batch of UK data showing record labor demand and surging wages, rising inflation but weaker-than-expected real GDP growth has a whiff of stagflation to it,"" Pickering said in a research note on Wednesday. ""While the risk of such an outcome remains low, in our view, it puts the [Bank of England] in a tricky position nonetheless,"" he added.The unexpectedly sharp increase in inflation could force the Bank of England to hike interest rates sooner than anticipated, Pickering said.The spike in UK inflation follows data out Tuesday showing that the rate of inflation in the United States slowed slightly in August as some price distortions eased, such as for used cars. But prices remain elevated across the economy amid persistent supply chain bottlenecks. ""There are too many reasons to expect supply shocks in other areas to be confident inflation isn't going to settle at [a] slightly uncomfortable level for a sustained period,"" Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes said in a note on Wednesday.","The annual rate of inflation rose by 3.2% in August, up from 2% in the 12 months to July.

CNN,Inflation,4,"Bacon prices have skyrocketed to record levels, and they might not go down anytime soon",https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/29/economy/bacon-prices-skyrocketing-pork/index.html?utm_term=link&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twCNN&utm_content=2021-09-29T17%3A15%3A05,"Bacon is more expensive for Americans than it has been in the past 40 years. And yes, that is accounting for inflation. That hankering for pork chops is costing you about 7% more than 12 months ago. The average price for that slab of bacon to accompany the Sunday morning spread has jumped nearly 28% during the past 12 months, Consumer Price Index data show.The supply chain issues and inflationary pressures that have become all-too common in these pandemic times certainly have played theirs roles in the pork price hikes, alongside a slew of industry-specific influence. President Joe Biden's administration, for its part, believes prices are high because a couple of large companies control the majority of market share, and has outlined plans to level the playing field. By some analysts' expectations, the higher prices aren't expected to ease anytime soon.How we got hereThe domestic pork supply chain was one of quickest to get knocked out of whack when the Covid-19 virus started its spread in the US. Panic-stricken consumers bought up deep freezers and cleared out meat counters. The food service channel effectively shut down overnight, breaking a major arm of the supply chain.Meatpacking plants -- where employees worked long shifts in close proximity to each other -- emerged as virus hotbeds. Lives were lost, plants were temporarily shuttered and federal investigations ensued.When those facilities shut down, the backlog of animals grew, resulting in millions of pigs being euthanized without processing into food. Additionally, producers, wary of getting ahead of demand with too much supply, started thinning their breeding herds — ultimately depressing this year's pork supply, said Adam Speck, economist with IHS Markit.Pork production is expected to close out the year 2% lower than 2020 levels, he said.In terms of demand, it's a different story.""Demand has been exceptional in the US, moving more volumes at retail than ever before seen,"" Speck said in an email to CNN Business. ""The combined effect of tighter supplies and stronger demand for proteins overall have contributed to this inflation.""With a lack of meat in cold storage late last year, the industry relied more on fresh animals, which in turn helped spike raw material prices, he said, adding it's likely those costs have peaked and that the indications from the futures markets show prices should go back to normal by June 2022. ""But do not expect a rapid price concession the next few months,"" Speck said, ""as retailers are typically slow to bring bacon prices back down.""Feed, freight and labor costs have also risen significantly, said Trey Malone, assistant professor and agricultural economist at Michigan State University.And that's not to mention the global influences, particularly the re-emergence of African Swine Fever. The disease, incurable and deadly to pigs, has spread across Asia in recent years and cropped up in the Dominican Republic in July 2021. It's the first time the virus has been confirmed in the Western Hemisphere in 40 years, according to the National Pork Producers CouncilIt represents a double-edged sword for the US pork industry: The valuable export business could increase in markets such as Vietnam; however, the continued spread of the virus and its greater proximity to the US have heightened biosecurity concerns.If a foreign animal disease were to enter the United States, it would devastate the domestic pork industry and cause billions of dollars in losses and shutter export markets, according to the NPPC. Earlier this month, the Biden Administration laid out a multi-tiered plan to combat consolidation and anti-competitive practices in the meat industry, which the administration alleges are creating the inflation. Four firms control between 55% to 85% of the market in pork, beef and poultry, National Economic Council economists wrote in a Sept. 8 briefing.The top four hog-processing firms control 66% of the market now — a doubling of the market share from 1976, according to the NEC.""That consolidation gives these middlemen the power to squeeze both consumers and farmers and ranchers,"" they wrote.Pork, beef and poultry have seen some of the highest price jumps among other food products since December 2020, climbing 12.1%, 14% and 6.6%, respectively, they wrote.In response, the Biden Administration and the US Department of Agriculture's stated plans of action include the enforcement of antitrust laws; investigations into price fixing; offering $1.4 billion in pandemic assistance to small producers, farmers and workers; and the investment of $500 million to support new competitive entrants.Amidst the high costs and continued volatility, some farmers, consumers and pork-reliant business owners are having to just sit back and eat it.""I've been in the restaurant business since the early '80s, and I've never seen anything like it,"" said chef Miguel Escobedo, who runs the Al Pastor Papi food truck in San Francisco.

CNN,Inflation,5,Biden's top economic adviser urges passage of economic bill to combat rising inflation,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/14/politics/brian-deese-inflation-cnntv/index.html?utm_content=2021-11-14T22%3A15%3A05&utm_term=link&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twCNN,"President Joe Biden's top economic adviser on Sunday cited rising inflation in the US as a reason for Congress to pass the President's massive economic package, arguing the legislation will help stymie rapidly rising prices of consumer goods. CNN's Allison Malloy contributed to this report. ""Well, inflation is high right now, and it is affecting consumers in their pocketbook and also in their outlook for the economy. But those concerns underscore why it's so important that we move forward on the Build Back Better legislation -- this legislation that the House is going to consider this week,"" Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."" ""This, more than anything, will go at the cost that Americans face,"" he added, noting that the bill's provisions won't add to any inflationary pressures. The comments from Deese come as House Democrats hope to pass the $1.75 trillion economic bill this week, pumping money into a number of social safety net programs that the White House aide argued ""go at lowering costs for American families."" Deese said he's ""confident"" that the chamber will approve the package this week. Deese acknowledged during his interview that inflation is ""high right now,"" and, when asked by Tapper when inflation will go back below the 2% level considered normal, he pointed to experts estimating it would happen in 2022.Deese would not directly answer whether Biden was willing to open the US' Strategic Petroleum Reserve or to stop gas and oil exports to address rising crude oil prices, telling Tapper: ""We are very committed to do everything we can to make sure that American consumers don't bear the brunt of high gas prices and volatile energy prices and the President has made clear that all options are on the table."" ""We're monitoring the situation very carefully,"" he said. Biden, like Deese, was noncommittal last week on ordering a Strategic Petroleum Reserve release after the OPEC+ coalition rejected calls from the US and other big oil consuming nations to increase output by more than planned in December. A release from the SPR, which is designed to protect the nation against a major disruption in oil supplies, would likely only provide modest, temporary relief from higher prices at the pump.This story has been updated with additional details Sunday.","""This, more than anything, will go at the cost that Americans face,"" Brian Deese says. Deese says inflation is ""high right",Actually what the president said was the only way inflation would go down is if we all backed his plan. Seriously?
