We have closed out our position in GME (GameStop),” the spokesman said in a statement.The spokesman also said that the firm, once among Wall Street’s best performers, is not collapsing. “The social media posts about Melvin Capital going bankrupt are categorically false,” he said.Earlier this week prominent hedge funds Citadel and Point72 Asset Management extended a $2.75 billion financial lifeline to the fund. People familiar with the fund said it lost almost 30% in the first three weeks of January.GameStop closed up 92.71% on Tuesday at $147.98, and is trading up 65% before the opening on Wednesday.Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; editing by Jason Neely

GameStop shares fell on Thursday following the curbs, which drew calls for scrutiny from regulators and outrage from celebrities and politicians on both sides of the political aisle.Robinhood said late on Friday opening new positions in 50 securities including GameStop is currently allowed, but limited.Koss Corp was up 53%, but both the headphone maker and GameStop remained below peaks reached earlier this week.Hedge funds and other short sellers had a bruising week. GameStop short sellers have endured mark-to-market losses of $19.75 billion so far this year, according to S3 Partners. Even so, the stock remained highly shorted, with $11.2 billion short interest.Related CoverageSee more storiesThe SEC issued a rare joint statement from its acting chair and commissioners that said it was working closely with other regulators and stock exchanges “to protect investors and to identify and pursue potential wrongdoing” and would “closely review actions ... that may disadvantage investors” or hinder their ability to trade stocks.The showdown between small traders and professional short-sellers also drew scrutiny from lawmakers, the White House and the attorneys general of New York and Texas.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued 13 civil investigative demands, the civil equivalent of a subpoena, on Friday to Robinhood and others that put curbs on stock trading, calling it “shockingly unprecedented and wrong.”The battle added to uncertainty in equity markets that had looked ripe for a pullback. Some funds were forced to sell some of their best-performing stocks, including Apple Inc, to cover billions of dollars in losses on short positions.All three main indexes suffered their biggest weekly fall since the end of October on Friday, closing down around 2%.[.N]The surge in volatility has led to a huge increase in volume, totaling over 20 billion shares in each of the past two sessions across U.S. exchanges for the most active trading days on record going back to 2014, according to Refinitiv data.The “Reddit stocks” have accounted for as much as 7.6% of that volume, according to Piper Sandler analyst Rich Repetto.“The markets were vulnerable to a decline ... and this Reddit activity was the catalyst that sort of triggered the sell-off,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.GameStop marked a near 400% weekly gain, eclipsed by Koss’s 1,800% week. AMC Entertainment rose 54% on Friday, and was up 278% for the week, while Express added almost 28%.Virgin Galactic closed up 2.7%, Bed Bath & Beyond was up 5%, and American Airlines fell 5% after a rally the prior session. Since the start of the week, BlackBerry Ltd more than doubled to touch $36 on Wednesday before easing back to $19.96 on Friday. [.TO] Silver continued a blistering rally.While some companies swept up in the so-called “Reddit rebellion” have used the opportunity to raise capital, most have said little about the volatility in their shares. GameStop did not reply to multiple requests for comment. AMC, BlackBerry and Koss did not immediately respond to requests for comment.For a full list of Reuters stories about the GameStop phenomenon, please see:Restrictions imposed on Thursday were driven by the high concentration of risk in hot stocks and by increased clearinghouse capital and deposit requirements, Piper Jaffrey said.While Robinhood eased the curbs on Friday, it was still not allowing purchases of fractional shares in GameStop and some other companies, meaning smaller investors must bet more to buy-in. The brokerage was also limiting the number of shares any one account could hold.London-based trading platform Freetrade disabled buy orders for U.S. stocks but will allow users to exit positions.While the battle could limit short-sellers’ influence on the market, analysts said, the fact remained that the prices of stocks will eventually fall if they are overvalued.“These moves ... can go a lot further than people can expect, but they end with a quick move back down,” said David Starr, vice president of quantitative analysis at Simpler Trading. “People race for the exits very, very quickly.”Citron Research’s Andrew Left, who sparked the conflict with a call against GameStop, said Citron would no longer publish short-selling research and would shift to writing on companies that he thinks hold value.“When we started Citron, it was to be against the establishment, but now we’ve actually become the establishment,” Left said in a video on Friday. “The Citron narrative is going to change and have a pivot.”Reporting by Sagarika Jaisinghani, Medha Singh, Sruthi Shankar, Munsif Vengatill, Devik Jain and Anirban Sen in Bengaluru; Fergal Smith in Toronto; Anna Irrera, Saqib Iqbal Ahmed, Lewis Krauskopf, John McCrank, Chris Prentice and April Joyner in New York; Susan Heavey in Washington; Sujata Rao-Coverley, Tom Wilson and Thyagaraju Adinarayan in London; Writing by Patrick Graham, Nick Zieminski and Sonya Hepinstall; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, David Gregorio and Daniel Wallis

Late Thursday, Robinhood said it will allow limited buying on Friday.“We’re done letting hedge fund billionaires treat the stock market like their personal playground, then taking their ball home as soon as they lose,” said U.S. Representative Ro Khanna, who noted that hedge funds were allowed to continue trading stocks while individual investors were handicapped by trading limits on Robinhood.Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republican Ted Cruz were among a growing number of lawmakers who agreed Congress needed more information.Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, tweeted the restriction was “unacceptable,” adding Congress needed to know more about the move “to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit.”Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, took to Twitter retweeting Ocasio-Cortez with rare words of agreement, writing “Fully agree.”Cruz told reporters that lawmakers needed answers “to why they halted the trading. ... it seems to favor a handful of rich influential players at the expense of ordinary citizens and ordinary traders.”White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki declined to comment on Robinhood’s actions.Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk backed Ocasio-Cortez’s criticism of Robinhood on Twitter responding “absolutely.”Senator Sherrod Brown, the incoming Banking committee, chair, said “People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they’re the ones getting hurt.”A Robinhood spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawmakers’ criticism.Republican Senators Mike Lee and Patrick Toomey also joined the critics of Robinhood as did Khanna, a Democrat.U.S. Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat, called the restriction “beyond absurd.”Tlaib urged on Twitter that Congress “have a hearing on Robinhood’s market manipulation. They’re blocking the ability to trade to protect Wall St. hedge funds, stealing millions of dollars from their users to protect people who’ve used the stock market as a casino for decades.”Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Doina Chiacu, Howard Goller and David Gregorio

F. Chang’s China Bistro, according to his LinkedIn profile. He did not respond to requests for comment.Shares of GameStop fell about 5% to $42.75 in extended trading after the announcement. The stock has risen about 140% this year, after paring most of the gains that sent short sellers scrambling to cover losing bets and saw the company hit a record high of $482.95.GameStop has also been targeted by shareholders pushing it to focus more on digital sales rather than its mall-based locations.New directors focused on this strategy have recently joined its board and the source said those additions had helped create more momentum for the CFO transition.GameStop said it has begun a search for a permanent CFO, adding that it would appoint Chief Accounting Officer Diana Jajeh as interim CFO if a permanent replacement was not found before Bell’s departure.Reporting by Subrat Patnaik, Ankit Ajmera and Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru, and Jessica DiNapoli in New York; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Jane Wardell
